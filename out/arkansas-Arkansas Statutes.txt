(2) There shall be no liability for compensation under this chapter where the injury or death was substantially occasioned by the willful intention of the injured employee to bring about such compensable injury or death.  (b) The primary obligation to pay compensation is upon the employer, and the procurement of a policy of insurance by an employer to cover the obligation in respect to this chapter shall not relieve the employer of the obligation.

 11-9-402. Liability of prime contractors and subcontractors - Sole proprietorships or partnerships.  (a) Where a subcontractor fails to secure compensation required by this chapter, the prime contractor shall be liable for compensation to the employees of the subcontractor unless there is an intermediate subcontractor who has workers' compensation coverage.  (b)(1) Any contractor or the contractor's insurance carrier who shall become liable for the payment of compensation on account of injury to or death of an employee of his or her subcontractor may recover from the subcontractor the amount of the compensation paid or for which liability is incurred.  (2) The claim for the recovery shall constitute a lien against any moneys due or to become due to the subcontractor from the prime contractor.  (3) A claim for recovery, however, shall not affect the right of the injured employee or the dependents of the deceased employee to recover compensation due from the prime contractor or his or her insurance carrier.  (c)(1)(A) When a sole proprietorship or partnership fails to elect to cover the sole proprietor or partners under this chapter, the prime contractor is not liable under this chapter for injuries sustained by the sole proprietor or partners if the sole proprietor or partners are not employees of the prime contractor.  (B)(i) A sole proprietor or the partners of a partnership who do not elect to be covered by this chapter and be deemed employees thereunder and who deliver to the prime contractor a current certification of noncoverage issued by the Workers' Compensation Commission shall be conclusively presumed not to be covered by the law or to be employees of the prime contractor during the term of his or her certification or any renewals thereof.  (ii) A certificate of noncoverage may not be presented to a subcontractor who does not have workers' compensation coverage.  (iii) This provision shall not affect the rights or coverage of any employees of the sole proprietor or of the partnership.

(3)(A) Any prime contractor who after being presented with a current certification of noncoverage by a sole proprietor or partnership nonetheless compels the sole proprietor or partnership to pay or contribute to workers' compensation coverage of that sole proprietor or partnership shall be guilty of a Class D felony.  (B) Furthermore, any prime contractor who compels a sole proprietor or partnership to obtain a certification of noncoverage when the sole proprietor or partnership does not desire to do so is guilty of a Class D felony.  (C) Furthermore, any applicant who makes a false statement when applying for a certification of noncoverage or any renewals thereof shall be guilty of a Class D felony.  (d)(1) A certification of noncoverage issued by the commission after July 1, 2001, shall be valid for two (2) years after the effective date stated thereon. Both the effective date and the expiration date must be listed on the face of the certificate by the commission. The certificate must expire at midnight two (2) years from its issue date, as noted on the face of the certificate.  (2) Any certification of noncoverage that is in effect on July 1, 2001, shall expire as follows:  (A) A certification of noncoverage issued in the years 1993 or 1994 shall expire at midnight on September 30, 2001;  (B) A certification of noncoverage issued in the years 1995 or 1996 shall expire at midnight on December 31, 2001;  (C) A certification of noncoverage issued in the years 1997 or 1998 shall expire at midnight on March 31, 2002; and  (D) A certification of noncoverage issued in the years 1999 or 2000 shall expire at midnight on June 30, 2002.

(A) The commission, as a condition to such authorization, may require the employer, except municipalities, counties, or the State of Arkansas or its political subdivisions, to deposit in a depository designated by the commission either an indemnity bond, irrevocable letter of credit, or securities of any kind and in an amount determined by the commission, subject to such reasonable conditions as the commission may prescribe. The conditions shall include authorization to the commission, in case of default, to sell any securities sufficient to pay compensation awards or to bring suit on the bonds or the letter of credit to procure prompt payment of compensation under this chapter.  (B) Any employer securing compensation in accordance with the provisions of subdivision (a)(2) of this section shall be known as a self-insurer and shall be classed as a carrier of its own insurance.  (C) A self-insurer may have the privilege of securing those portions of the payment of compensation under this chapter as the self-insurer shall elect by insuring the portions with a company approved by the commission. The liability of the company shall be limited to those features and liabilities of this chapter as are expressly stated, and none other;  (3)(A) The commission, under such rules and regulations as it may prescribe, may permit two (2) or more employers engaged in the same type of business activity or pursuit to enter into agreements to pool their liabilities under this section for the purpose of qualifying as self-insurers, and each such approved group shall be classified as an homogeneous self-insurer.  (B)(i) The commission, under such rules and regulations as it may prescribe, may permit two (2) or more employers who are members of the same trade or professional association to enter into agreements to pool their liabilities under this section for the purpose of qualifying as self-insurers, and each such approved group shall be classified as a common self-insurer.  (ii) The trade or professional association shall have been in active existence for at least three (3) years; such associations shall have a constitution or by-laws; and all trustees shall be participants in the common self-insurer program, shall have members that support the association by regular payment of dues on an annual, semiannual, quarterly, or monthly basis, and shall be created in good faith for purposes other than that of creating workers' compensation common self-insurer pools.  (iii) No two (2) trade or professional associations shall be allowed to combine or join each other and qualify as a common self-insurer.  (C) In order to qualify as group self-insurers, these groups shall furnish to or satisfy the commission as to the following:  (i) An application on a form prescribed by the commission by an elected board of trustees to establish a self-insurance fund to be administered under the direction of the trustees;  (ii) The application shall be accompanied by:   (a) An indemnity agreement in a form satisfactory to the commission jointly and severally binding the groups and each member of the groups to comply with the provisions of the Workers' Compensation Law, Â§ 11-9-101 et seq.; and   (b) An individual application by each member of the groups applying for coverage in the fund;  (iii) A current, audited financial statement of each member of the groups showing a combined net worth of all members applying for coverage of not less than one million dollars ($1,000,000), a combined ratio of current assets to current liabilities of not less than one-to-one, and working capital of an amount establishing financial ability and liquidity sufficient to pay normal compensation claims promptly;  (iv)(a) That the groups deposit and maintain with the commission acceptable securities or have posted a surety bond issued by a corporate surety authorized to do business in the State of Arkansas, in an amount determined by the commission, but not less than two hundred thousand dollars ($200,000).   (b) However, this subdivision shall not be applicable to municipalities, counties, or the State of Arkansas and its political subdivisions;  (v) That there exist ample facilities and competent personnel of good character within the groups, or through an approved service organization, for the groups to service their own programs with respect to underwriting matters, claims and adjusting, industrial safety engineering, accounting, and financial management;  (vi)(a) That the groups maintain excess insurance with an insurance company authorized to do business in this state in an amount acceptable to the commission.   (b) However, this subdivision (a)(3)(C)(vi) shall not be applicable to municipalities, counties, or the State of Arkansas and its political subdivisions.  (vii)(a) That such financial statements, payroll records, accident experience, and compensation reports and such other reports and statements are filed at such time and in such manner as the commission shall require.   (b) However, any fund which fails or refuses to file the reports within the time limits prescribed by the commission shall be subject to a civil penalty in such amount as the commission may prescribe not to exceed one hundred dollars ($100) per infraction per day, and the failure or refusal may be considered good cause for revocation or suspension of self-insurance privileges;  (4) Each member of the groups shall file financial reports and statements at such times and in such manner as the commission may require to satisfy itself as to the continued financial stability of the member;  (5) In order to continue to qualify as a homogeneous self-insurer fund or common self-insurer fund, the groups shall continue to meet the minimum requirements as set forth in subdivision (a)(3) of this section or as prescribed by the commission.  (b)(1) Except for the initial qualification of the groups, a certified audited financial statement shall not be required of any member of a group either for initial membership or as a condition for continued membership in the group.  (2) However, each financial statement filed with the commission shall be duly certified by the president and treasurer of the member, in the case of a corporation, and by the owner and general partners, respectively, in the case of an individual proprietorship or partnership, to the effect that such financial statement is true and correct to the best of the knowledge and belief of the officer, individual owner, or partner and truly reflects the financial condition of the member.  (c) Any person who knowingly files a false or fraudulent financial statement under the provisions of this chapter shall, upon conviction, be fined not more than ten thousand dollars ($10,000) or imprisoned not more than five (5) years, or both.  (d) Jurisdiction for the enforcement of the provisions of this chapter or any appeal therefrom shall be in the Circuit Court of Pulaski County. The underlying purpose of this chapter is to assure the payment of benefits due employees, and this chapter shall be liberally construed to that end.  (e)(1) The commission may suspend or revoke any authorization to a self-insurer for a good cause shown after a hearing at which the self-insurer shall be entitled to be heard in person or by counsel and to present evidence.  (2) No suspension or revocation shall affect the liability of any self-insurer already incurred.  (f) Authorization to write compensation insurance under this chapter shall be given to a carrier only after the carrier has received a certificate of authority from the Insurance Commissioner to transact the business of workers' compensation insurance in Arkansas and the commission has been notified in writing of the issuance of the certificate of authority.

===================================================================



 

 11-9-405. Substitution of carrier for employer.  (a) In any case where the employer is not a self-insurer, in order that the liability for compensation imposed by this chapter may be most effectively discharged by the employer and in order that the administration of this chapter with respect to that liability may be facilitated, the Workers' Compensation Commission shall by regulation provide for the discharge by the carrier, for the employer, of the obligations and duties of the employer with respect to such liability imposed by this chapter upon the employer as it considers proper in order to effectuate the provisions of this chapter.  (b) For such purpose:  (1) Notice to or knowledge of an employer of the occurrence of the injury shall be notice to or knowledge of the carrier;  (2) Jurisdiction over the employer by the commission or by any court under this chapter shall be jurisdiction over the carrier; and  (3) Any requirements by the commission or any court under any compensation order, finding, or decision shall be binding upon the carrier in the same manner and to the same extent as upon the employer.

(2) This subsection shall not affect any other liability of the employer under this chapter.  (b)(1) Whenever the commission has reason to believe that any employer required to secure the payment of compensation under this chapter has failed to do so, the commission shall serve upon the employer a proposed order declaring the employer to be in violation of this chapter and containing the amount, if any, of the civil penalty to be assessed against the employer pursuant to subdivision (b)(5) of this section.  (2)(A) An employer may contest a proposed order of the commission issued pursuant to subdivision (b)(1) of this section by filing with the commission, within twenty (20) days of receipt of the proposed order, a written request for a hearing.  (B) Such a request for a hearing need not be in any particular form but shall specify the grounds upon which the person contests the proposed order, the proposed assessment, or both.  (C) If a written request for hearing is not filed with the commission within this time, the proposed order, the proposed penalty, or both, shall be a final order of the commission and shall not be subject to further review by any court.  (D) A proposed order by the commission pursuant to this section is prima facie correct, and the burden is upon the employer to prove that the proposed order is incorrect.  (3)(A) If the employer alleges that a carrier has contracted to provide it workers' compensation insurance coverage for the period in question, the employer shall include the allegation in its request for hearing and shall name the carrier.  (B) The commission shall promptly notify the carrier of the employer's allegation and of the date of hearing.  (C) The carrier shall promptly, and no later than five (5) days prior to the hearing, respond in writing to the employer's allegation by providing evidence of coverage for the period in question or by affirmatively denying the employer's allegation.

===================================================================



 

 11-9-408. Insurance policies.  (a) Contents. Every policy or contract of insurance issued by a carrier to an employer to secure the payment of compensation under this chapter shall contain:  (1)(A) Provisions that identify the insured employer and either identify each covered employee or describe covered employees by class or type of labor performed and the estimated number of employees of each such class or type.  (B) No single policy of workers' compensation insurance may be issued to any group of employers who are unaffiliated with one another in terms of ownership, control, or right to participate in the profits of the affiliated enterprises;  (2) Provisions that insolvency or bankruptcy of the employer or discharge therein shall not relieve the carrier from payment of compensation for compensable injuries sustained by an employee during the term of the policy or contract;  (3)(A) The agreement of the carrier that it will promptly pay to the person entitled to compensation every installment of compensation that may be awarded or agreed upon and that this obligation shall not be affected by any default of the employer or by any default in the giving of any notice required by the policy or otherwise.  (B) The agreement shall be construed to be a direct obligation by the carrier to the person entitled to compensation, enforceable in that person's name; and  (4) Such other provisions as the State Insurance Department allows or requires carriers to include in workers' compensation policies as otherwise provided at Â§ 23-67-301 et seq.  (b) Cancellation. (1) An employer may cancel coverage with a carrier by giving the carrier at least thirty (30) days' notice, unless a shorter period is permitted under subdivision (b)(1)(B) of this section.  (A) Cancellation of coverage is effective at 12:01 a.m. thirty (30) days after the date the cancellation notice is received by the carrier, unless a later date is specified in the notice to the carrier.  (B)(i) An employer may cancel coverage effective less than thirty (30) days after written notice is received by the carrier where the employer obtains other coverage or becomes a self-insurer.  (ii) A cancellation under this subdivision is effective immediately upon the effective date of the other coverage or upon authorization as a self-insurer.  (2)(A) A notice of cancellation from the carrier shall state the hour and date that cancellation is effective.  (B) A carrier shall not cancel coverage issued to an employer under this chapter prior to the date specified for expiration in the policy or contract or until at least thirty (30) days have elapsed after a notice of cancellation has been mailed to the Workers' Compensation Commission and to the employer, or until ten (10) days have elapsed after the notice has been mailed to the employer and to the commission if the cancellation is for nonpayment of premium.  (C) However, if the employer procures other insurance within the notice period, the effective date of the new policy shall be the cancellation date of the old policy.  (3) Cancellation of coverage by an employer or a carrier shall in no way limit liability that was incurred under the policy or contract prior to the effective date of cancellation.  (c) Coverage. (1) No policy or contract of insurance shall be issued against liability under this chapter unless the policy or contract covers the entire liability of the employer. Split coverage whereby some employees of an employer are insured by one carrier and other employees are insured by another carrier, or by the Arkansas Workers' Compensation Insurance Plan, Â§ 23-67-301 et seq., or a plan of self-insurance is expressly prohibited except for:  (A) A policy issued in accordance with Â§ 23-94-409 so long as all employees performing services for a client are covered under the same policy, contract, or plan; or  (B) A policy issued covering the liability of an employer or of multiple employers as to specific jobs, ventures, contracts, or undertakings, but only if the policy meets with the reasonable satisfaction and approval of the Insurance Commissioner that the policy is in the best interest of the employers and the employees concerned and does not unduly or improperly affect the continuity of workers' compensation coverage by seriously and negatively affecting other carriers and agents with outstanding policies issued to any of the employers in issue.  (2) As to any questions of liability between the employer and the carrier, the terms of the policy or contract shall govern.

(c) Extra-Hazardous Employer Program. (1)(A) In cooperation with and with the assistance of the Department of Labor and the State Insurance Department, the division shall develop a program, including injury frequency, to identify extra-hazardous employers.

(B) The safety consultant shall file a written report with the division and the employer setting out any hazardous conditions or practices identified by the safety consultation.  (3) The employer and the consultant shall formulate a specific accident prevention plan which addresses the hazards identified by the consultant. The employer shall comply with the accident prevention plan.

(B) If the division determines that the employer has complied with the terms of the accident prevention plan or has implemented other acceptable corrective measures, the division shall so certify.  (C) An employer who the division determines has failed or refused to implement the accident prevention plan or other suitable hazard abatement measures is subject to civil penalties as follows:  (i) The commission may assess a civil penalty against an employer who fails or refuses to implement the accident prevention plan or other suitable hazard abatement procedures in an amount up to one thousand dollars ($1,000) per day of violation payable to the Death and Permanent Total Disability Trust Fund; and  (ii) Furthermore, the commission may petition the Circuit Court of Pulaski County, or of the county where the business is located, for an order enjoining the employer from engaging in further employment until such time as the employer implements the prevention plan or abatement measure described above or makes payment of all civil penalties.  (6) If, at the time of the inspection required under subdivision (c)(5)(A) of this section, the employer continues to exceed the injury frequencies that may reasonably be expected in that employer's business or industry, the division shall continue to monitor the safety conditions at the work site and may formulate additional safety plans reasonably calculated to abate hazards. The employer shall comply with the plans and may be subject to additional penalties for failure to implement the plan or plans.  (7) An employer may request a hearing before the full commission to contest findings made by the division under this section.  (8) The identification as an extra-hazardous employer under this section is not admissible in any judicial proceeding unless the commission has determined that the employer is not in compliance with this section and unless that determination has not been reversed or superseded at the time of the event giving rise to the judicial proceeding.  (d)(1) Accident Prevention Services. Any insurance company licensed to provide casualty insurance in the State of Arkansas and desiring to write workers' compensation insurance in Arkansas shall maintain or provide accident prevention services as a prerequisite to write workers' compensation insurance. The services shall be adequate to furnish accident prevention programs required by the nature of its policyholders' operations and shall include surveys, recommendations, training programs, consultations, analyses of accident causes, industrial hygiene, and industrial health services to implement the program of accident prevention services.  (2) Notice that services are available to the policyholder from the insurance company must appear in no less than ten (10) point bold type on the front of each workers' compensation insurance policy delivered or issued for delivery in the state.  (3) At least once each year, each insurance company writing workers' compensation insurance in Arkansas must submit to the division detailed information on the type of accident prevention services offered to that insurance company's policyholders. The information must include any additional information required by the commission.  (4) In cooperation with and with the assistance of the Department of Labor and the State Insurance Department, the division shall conduct inspections to determine the adequacy of the accident prevention services required by subdivision (d)(1) of this section at least every two (2) years for each insurance company writing workers' compensation insurance in Arkansas.  (5) If the insurance company does not maintain or provide the accident prevention services required by this subsection, or if the insurance company does not use the services in a reasonable manner to prevent injury to employees of its policyholders, the insurance company may be subjected to the same civil penalties as are assessable and enforceable against employers as set forth above in subdivision (c)(5)(C) of this section and shall be subject to suspension or revocation of license to do business in this state by the Insurance Commissioner.  (6) The commission shall employ the qualified personnel necessary to enforce this section.  (e) Immunity from Certain Liability. (1) Except as provided in subdivision (d)(5) of this section, the insurance company, the agent, servant, or employee of the insurance company or self-insured employer, or a safety consultant who performs a safety consultation under this section shall have no liability with respect to any accident based on the allegation that the accident was caused or could have been prevented by a program, inspection, or other activity or service undertaken by the insurance company or self-insured employer for the prevention of accidents in connection with operations of the employer.  (2) Provided, however, this immunity shall not affect the liability of the insurance carrier or self-insured employer for compensation or as otherwise provided in this chapter.  (f) Exclusive Remedy. This section does not create an independent cause of action at law or in equity.

 11-9-410. Third-party liability.  (a) Liability Unaffected. (1)(A) The making of a claim for compensation against any employer or carrier for the injury or death of an employee shall not affect the right of the employee, or his or her dependents, to make a claim or maintain an action in court against any third party for the injury, but the employer or the employer's carrier shall be entitled to reasonable notice and opportunity to join in the action.   (B) If they, or either of them, join in the action, they shall be entitled to a first lien upon two-thirds (2/3) of the net proceeds recovered in the action that remain after the payment of the reasonable costs of collection, for the payment to them of the amount paid and to be paid by them as compensation to the injured employee or his or her dependents.  (2) The commencement of an action by an employee or his or her dependents against a third party for damages by reason of an injury to which this chapter is applicable, or the adjustment of any claim, shall not affect the rights of the injured employee or his or her dependents to recover compensation, but any amount recovered by the injured employee or his or her dependents from a third party shall be applied as follows:  (A) Reasonable costs of collection shall be deducted;  (B) Then, in every case, one-third (1/3) of the remainder shall belong to the injured employee or his or her dependents, as the case may be;  (C) The remainder, or so much as is necessary to discharge the actual amount of the liability of the employer and the carrier; and  (D) Any excess shall belong to the injured employee or his or her dependents.  (b) Subrogation.

However, the employer or the carrier must notify the claimant in writing that the claimant has the right to hire a private attorney to pursue any benefits to which the claimant is entitled in addition to the subrogation interest against any third party responsible for the injury or death.  (2) After reasonable notice and opportunity to be represented in the action has been given to the compensation beneficiary, the liability of the third party to the compensation beneficiary shall be determined in the action, as well as the third party's liability to the employer and carrier.  (3)(A) After recovery shall be had against the third party, by suit or otherwise, the compensation beneficiary shall be entitled to any amount recovered over and above the amount that the employer and carrier have paid or are liable for in compensation, after deducting reasonable costs of collection.  (B) In no event shall the compensation beneficiary be entitled to less than one-third (1/3) of the amount recovered from the third party, after deducting the reasonable cost of collection.  (4) An employer or carrier who is liable for compensation under this chapter on account of injury or death of an employee shall be entitled to maintain a third party action against the employer's uninsured motorist coverage or underinsured motorist coverage.  (5) The purpose and intent of this subsection is to prevent double payment to the employee.  (c) Settlement of Claims. (1) Settlement of claims under subsections (a) and (b) of this section must have the approval of the court or of the commission, except that the distribution of that portion of the settlement which represents the compensation payable under this chapter must have the approval of the commission.  (2) Where liability is admitted to the injured employee or his or her dependents by the employer or carrier, the cost of collection may be deducted from that portion of the settlement under subsections (a) or (b) of this section representing compensation, upon direction and approval of the commission.  (3) No party shall settle a claim under subsections (a) and (b) of this section without first giving three (3) days' written notice to all parties with an interest in the claim of the intent to settle.  (4) Each party with an interest in a claim under subsections (a) and (b) shall cooperate with all other parties in litigation or settlement of such claims.

(B) A petition for change of physician shall be expedited by the commission.  (e) Any section or subsection of this chapter notwithstanding, the injured employee shall have direct access to any optometric or ophthalmologic medical service provider who agrees to provide services under the rules, terms, and conditions regarding services performed by the managed care entity initially chosen by the employer for the treatment and management of eye injuries or conditions. Such optometric or ophthalmologic medical service provider shall be considered a certified provider by the commission.  (f) The commission is authorized to promulgate any other rules or regulations as may be necessary to carry out the provisions of this section and its purpose of controlling medical costs through the establishment of a managed care system.

(iii) Where the employer does not have a contract with a managed care organization certified by the commission, the claimant employee, however, shall be allowed to change physicians by petitioning the commission one (1) time only for a change of physician, to a physician who must either be associated with any managed care entity certified by the commission or be the regular treating physician of the employee who maintains the employee's medical records and with whom the employee has a bona fide doctor-patient relationship demonstrated by a history of regular treatment prior to the onset of the compensable injury, but only if the primary care physician agrees to refer the employee to a physician associated with any managed care entity certified by the commission for any specialized treatment, including physical therapy, and only if the primary care physician agrees to comply with all the rules, terms, and conditions regarding services performed by any managed care entity certified by the commission.

(2) Where the injured employee was working on a piece basis, the average weekly wage shall be determined by dividing the earnings of the employee by the number of hours required to earn the wages during the period not to exceed fifty-two (52) weeks preceding the week in which the accident occurred and by multiplying this hourly wage by the number of hours in a full-time workweek in the employment.  (b) Overtime earnings are to be added to the regular weekly wages and shall be computed by dividing the overtime earnings by the number of weeks worked by the employee in the same employment under the contract of hire in force at the time of the accident, not to exceed a period of fifty-two (52) weeks preceding the accident.  (c) If, because of exceptional circumstances, the average weekly wage cannot be fairly and justly determined by the above formulas, the commission may determine the average weekly wage by a method that is just and fair to all parties concerned.

(a) A permanent partial disability not scheduled in Â§ 11-9-521 shall be apportioned to the body as a whole, which shall have a value of four hundred fifty (450) weeks, and there shall be paid compensation to the injured employee for the proportionate loss of use of the body as a whole resulting from the injury.  (b)(1) In considering claims for permanent partial disability benefits in excess of the employee's percentage of permanent physical impairment, the Workers' Compensation Commission may take into account, in addition to the percentage of permanent physical impairment, such factors as the employee's age, education, work experience, and other matters reasonably expected to affect his or her future earning capacity.  (2) However, so long as an employee, subsequent to his or her injury, has returned to work, has obtained other employment, or has a bona fide and reasonably obtainable offer to be employed at wages equal to or greater than his or her average weekly wage at the time of the accident, he or she shall not be entitled to permanent partial disability benefits in excess of the percentage of permanent physical impairment established by a preponderance of the medical testimony and evidence.

(2) Included in the stated intent of this section is to enable an employer to reduce or diminish payments of benefits for a functional disability, disability in excess of permanent physical impairment, which, in fact, no longer exists, or exists because of discharge for misconduct in connection with the work, or because the employee left his or her work voluntarily and without good cause connected with the work.  (d) In accordance with this section, the commission may reconsider the question of functional disability and change a previously awarded disability rating based on facts occurring since the original disability determination if any party makes application for reconsideration within one (1) year after the occurrence of the facts.  (e) In considering a claim for permanent disability, the commission and the courts shall not consider the odd-lot doctrine.  (f)(1) Permanent total disability benefits shall be paid during the period of permanent total disability until the employee reaches the age of sixty-five (65); provided, with respect to permanent total disabilities resulting from injuries which occur after age sixty (60), regardless of the age of the employee, permanent total disability benefits are payable for a period of two hundred sixty (260) weeks.  (2) The purpose and intent of this subsection is to prohibit workers' compensation from becoming a retirement supplement.  (g)(1)(A) The commission, after a public hearing, shall adopt an impairment rating guide to be used in the assessment of anatomical impairment.  (B) The guide shall not include pain as a basis for impairment.  (2) The impairment rating guide adopted by the commission shall be subject to review by the General Assembly before April 1 of every odd-numbered year beginning with the regular session of 1999.

===================================================================



 

11-9-525. Compensation for disability - Second injuries.
(a)  (1)  The Second Injury Trust Fund established in this chapter is a special fund designed to ensure that an employer employing a worker with a disability will not, in the event that the worker suffers an injury on the job, be held liable for a greater disability or impairment than actually occurred while the worker was in his or her employment.
     (2)  The employee is to be fully protected in that the fund pays the worker the difference between the employer's liability and the balance of his or her disability or impairment that results from all disabilities or impairments combined.
     (3)  It is intended that latent conditions that are not known to the employee or employer not be considered previous disabilities or impairments which would give rise to a claim against the fund.
(b)  (1)  Commencing January 1, 1981, all cases of permanent disability or impairment in which there has been previous disability or impairment shall be compensated as provided in this section.
     (2)  Compensation shall be computed on the basis of the average earnings at the time of the last injury.
     (3)  If any employee who has a permanent partial disability or impairment, whether from compensable injury or otherwise, receives a subsequent compensable injury resulting in additional permanent partial disability or impairment so that the degree or percentage of disability or impairment caused by the combined disabilities or impairments is greater than that which would have resulted from the last injury, considered alone and of itself, and if the employee is entitled to receive compensation on the basis of combined disabilities or impairments, then the employer at the time of the last injury shall be liable only for the degree or percentage of disability or impairment that would have resulted from the last injury had there been no preexisting disability or impairment.
     (4)  After the compensation liability of the employer for the last injury, considered alone, which shall be no greater than the actual anatomical impairment resulting from the last injury, has been determined by an administrative law judge or the Workers' Compensation Commission, the degree or percentage of employee's disability that is attributable to all injuries or conditions existing at the time the last injury was sustained shall then be determined by the administrative law judge or the commission, and the degree or percentage of disability or impairment that existed prior to the last injury plus the disability or impairment resulting from the combined disability shall be determined, and compensation for that balance, if any, shall be paid out of the fund provided for in § 11-9-301.
     (5)  If the previous disability or impairment, whether from compensable injury or otherwise, and the last injury together result in permanent total disability, the employer at the time of the last injury shall be liable only for the actual anatomical impairment resulting from the last injury considered alone and of itself. However, if the compensation for which the employer at the time of the last injury is liable is less than the compensation provided in §§ 11-9-501 — 11-9-506 for permanent total disability, then, in addition to the compensation for which the employer is liable and after the completion of payment of compensation by the employer, the employee shall be paid the remainder of the compensation that would be due for permanent total disability under §§ 11-9-501 — 11-9-506 out of the fund.
     (6)  The Treasurer of State shall be the custodian of the fund, and any interest accruing shall be added thereto.
     (7)  The commission shall direct the distribution of the funds from the fund.
(c)  (1)  In all cases in which a recovery against the fund is sought for permanent partial disability or for permanent total disability, the Treasurer of State as custodian shall be named as a party and shall be entitled to defend against the claim.
     (2)  The Treasurer of State, with the advice and consent of the Attorney General, may enter into settlements as contemplated by §§ 11-9-804 and 11-9-805.
     (3)  All awards for permanent partial disability or for permanent total disability affecting the fund shall be subject to the provisions of the Workers' Compensation Law, § 11-9-101 et seq., governing review and appeal.
(d)  (1)  If more than one (1) injury in the same employment causes concurrent temporary disabilities, weekly benefits shall be payable only for the longest and largest paying disability.
     (2)  If more than one (1) injury in the same employment causes concurrent and consecutive permanent partial disability, weekly benefits for each subsequent disability shall not begin until the end of the compensation period for the prior disability.
(e)  (1)  No claims under this section shall be made on or after January 1, 2008.

--->arkansas--->Arkansas Statutes--->Chapter 9 Workers' Compensation--->Subchapter 5 Accidental Injury or Death (11-9-501 through 11-9-530)--->11-9-527. Compensation for death.
===================================================================



 

 11-9-527. Compensation for death.  (a) Funeral Expenses. If death results from an injury occurring on or after July 1, 1993, the employer shall pay the actual funeral expenses, not exceeding the sum of six thousand dollars ($6,000).  (b) Time of Death. If death does not result within one (1) year from the date of the accident or within the first three (3) years of the period for compensation payments fixed by the compensation order, a rebuttable presumption shall arise that the death did not result from the injury.  (c) Beneficiaries - Amounts. Subject to the limitations as set out in Â§ 11-9-501 - 11-9-506, compensation for the death of an employee shall be paid to those persons who were wholly and actually dependent upon the deceased employee in the following percentage of the average weekly wage of the employee and in the following order of preference:  (1)(A)(i) To the widow if there is no child, thirty-five percent (35%), and the compensation shall be paid until her death or remarriage.  (ii) However, the widow shall establish, in fact, some dependency upon the deceased employee before she will be entitled to benefits as provided in this section;  (B)(i) To the widower if there is no child, thirty-five percent (35%), and the compensation shall be paid until his death or remarriage.  (ii) However, the widower shall establish, in fact, some dependency upon the deceased employee before he will be entitled to benefits as provided in this section;  (2) To the widow or widower if there is a child, the compensation payable under subdivision (c)(1) of this section and fifteen percent (15%) on account of each child;  (3)(A) To one (1) child if there is no widow or widower, fifty percent (50%).  (B) If more than one (1) child, and there is no widow or widower, fifteen percent (15%) for each child, and in addition thereto, thirty-five percent (35%) to the children as a class, to be divided equally among them;  (4) To the parents, twenty-five percent (25%) each;  (5) To brothers, sisters, grandchildren, and grandparents, fifteen percent (15%) each.  (d) Terminations of Dependence. (1) In the event the widow remarries before full and complete payment to her of the benefits provided in subsection (c) of this section, there shall be paid to her a lump sum equal to compensation for one hundred four (104) weeks, subject to the limitation set out in Â§ 11-9-501 - 11-9-506.  (2) A physically or mentally incapacitated child, grandchild, brother, or sister shall be entitled to compensation as a dependent of the deceased employee without regard to age or marital status, but if physically or mentally capacitated to earn a livelihood, dependency shall terminate with the attainment of eighteen (18) years of age or upon marriage. However, benefits to an otherwise eligible child shall not terminate at the age of eighteen (18) years provided the child is a full-time student who has not attained the age of twenty-five (25) years.  (e) Apportionment of Benefits. Where, because of the limitation in subsection (c) of this section, a person or class of persons cannot receive the percentage of compensation specified as payable to or on account of the person or class, there shall be available to the person or class that proportion of the percentage which, when added to the total percentage payable to all persons having priority or preference, will not exceed a total of sixty-five percent (65%), which proportion shall be paid:  (1) To that person; or  (2) To that class in equal shares unless the Worker's Compensation Commission determines otherwise in accordance with the provisions of subsection (f) of this section.  (f) Determination of Beneficiaries Within Class. If the commission determines that payments in accordance with subdivision (e)(2) of this section would provide no substantial benefit to any person of the class, it may provide for the payment of the compensation to the persons within the class whom it considers will be most benefited by the payment.  (g) Cessation of Compensation to Part. Upon the cessation of compensation under this section to or on account of any person, the compensation of the remaining persons entitled to compensation for the unexpired part of the period during which their compensation is payable shall be that which the persons would have received if they had been the only persons entitled to compensation at the time of the decedent's death.  (h) Determination of Dependency. All questions of dependency shall be determined as of the time of the injury.  (i) Partial Dependency. (1) If the employee leaves dependents who are only partially dependent upon his or her earnings for support at the time of injury, the compensation payable for partial dependency shall be in the proportion that the partial dependency bears to total dependency.  (2) In any claim for partial dependency where the average weekly contributions for support were not such as to entitle all dependents to compensation in the aggregate sum of seven dollars ($7.00) per week, the dependents shall receive compensation for a period not to exceed four hundred fifty (450) weeks in an amount not to exceed the amount of average weekly contributions of the deceased employee for the support of the dependents.

(2) If a written request for hearing is not filed with the commission within this time, the proposed order, proposed penalty, or both, shall be a final order of the commission.  (3) Such a request for a hearing need not be in any particular form but shall specify the grounds upon which the person contests the proposed order, the proposed assessment, or both.  (4) A proposed order by the commission pursuant to this section is prima facie correct, and the burden is upon the employer to prove that the proposed order is incorrect.  (g) Hearings conducted under this section shall proceed as provided in Â§ 11-9-704 - 11-9-711.  (h) If an employer fails to pay any civil penalty assessed against the employer after an order issued pursuant to this section has become final by operation of law, the commission may petition the circuit court of the county wherein is located the employer's principal place of business for an order enjoining the employer from engaging in further employment or conduct of business or until such time as the employer makes all required reports and pays all civil penalties.

--->arkansas--->Arkansas Statutes--->Chapter 9 Workers' Compensation--->Subchapter 6 Occupational Disease (11-9-601 through 11-9-603)--->11-9-601. Compensation generally.
===================================================================



 

  11-9-601. Compensation generally.  (a) Where an employee suffers from an occupational disease as defined in this subchapter and is disabled or dies as a result of the disease and where the disease was due to the nature of the occupation or process in which he or she was employed within the period previous to his or her disablement as limited in subsection (g) of this section, then the employee, or, in case of death, his or her dependents, shall be entitled to compensation as if the disablement or death were caused by injury, except as otherwise provided in this subchapter.  (b) No compensation shall be payable for an occupational disease if the employee, at the time of entering into the employment of the employer by whom the compensation would otherwise be payable, falsely represented himself or herself in writing as not having previously been disabled, laid off, or compensated in damages or otherwise, because of the disease.  (c)(1) Where an occupational disease is aggravated by any other disease or infirmity, not itself compensable, or where disability or death from any other cause, not itself compensable, is aggravated, prolonged, accelerated, or in any way contributed to by an occupational disease, the compensation payable shall be reduced and limited to the proportion only of the compensation that would be payable if the occupational disease were the sole cause of the disability or death as the occupational disease, as a causative factor, bears to all the causes of the disability or death.  (2) The reduction in compensation is to be effected by reducing the number of weekly or monthly payments or the amounts of the payments, as under the circumstances of the particular case may be for the best interest of the claimant.  (d) No compensation for death from an occupational disease shall be payable to any person whose relationship to the deceased which, under the provisions of this chapter, would give right to compensation arose subsequent to the beginning of the first compensable disability except to afterborn children of a marriage existing at the beginning of the disability.  (e)(1)(A) "Occupational disease", as used in this chapter, unless the context otherwise requires, means any disease that results in disability or death and arises out of and in the course of the occupation or employment of the employee or naturally follows or unavoidably results from an injury as that term is defined in this chapter.  (B) However, a causal connection between the occupation or employment and the occupational disease must be established by a preponderance of the evidence.  (2) No compensation shall be payable for any contagious or infectious disease unless contracted in the course of employment in or immediate connection with a hospital or sanitorium in which persons suffering from that disease are cared for or treated.  (3) No compensation shall be payable for any ordinary disease of life to which the general public is exposed.  (f)(1) Where compensation is payable for an occupational disease, the employer in whose employment the employee was last injuriously exposed to the hazards of the disease and the carrier, if any, on the risk when the employee was last injuriously exposed under the employer shall be liable.  (2) The amount of the compensation shall be based upon the average weekly wage of the employee when last injuriously exposed under the employer, and the notice of injury and claim for compensation, as required pursuant to this subchapter, shall be given and made to the employer.  (g)(1) An employer shall not be liable for any compensation for an occupational disease unless:  (A) The disease is due to the nature of an employment in which the hazards of the disease actually exist and are characteristic thereof and peculiar to the trade, occupation, process, or employment and is actually incurred in his or her employment. This includes any disease due to or attributable to exposure to or contact with any radioactive material by an employee in the course of his or her employment;  (B) Disablement or death results within three (3) years in case of silicosis or asbestosis, or one (1) year in case of any other occupational disease, except a diseased condition caused by exposure to X rays, radioactive substances, or ionizing radiation, after the last injurious exposure to the disease in the employment; or  (C) In case of death, death follows continuous disability from the disease, commencing within the period above limited, for which compensation has been paid or awarded or timely claim made as provided in this subchapter and results within seven (7) years after the last exposure.  (2) However, in case of a diseased condition caused by exposure to X rays, radioactive substances, or ionizing radiation only, the limitations expressed do not apply.      




===================================================================
--->arkansas--->Arkansas Statutes--->Chapter 9 Workers' Compensation--->Subchapter 6 Occupational Disease (11-9-601 through 11-9-603)--->11-9-602. Compensation for silicosis or asbestosis.
===================================================================



 

 11-9-602. Compensation for silicosis or asbestosis.  (a) As used in this subchapter, unless the context otherwise requires:  (1) "Asbestosis" means the characteristic fibrotic condition of the lungs caused by the inhalation of asbestos dust; and  (2) "Silicosis" means the characteristic fibrotic condition of the lungs caused by the inhalation of silica dust.  (b) In the absence of conclusive evidence in favor of the claim, disability or death from silicosis or asbestosis shall be presumed not to be due to the nature of any occupation within the provision of this subchapter unless during the ten (10) years immediately preceding the date of disablement the employee has been exposed to the inhalation of silica dust or asbestos dust over a period of not less than five (5) years, two (2) years of which shall have been in this state, under a contract of employment existing in this state. However, if the employee has been employed by the same employer during the whole of the five-year period, his or her right to compensation against the employer shall not be affected by the fact that he or she had been employed during any part of the period outside of this state.  (c) Except as in this subchapter otherwise provided, compensation for disability from uncomplicated silicosis or asbestosis shall be payable in accordance with the provisions of Â§ 11-9-519 - 11-9-526. However, no compensation shall be payable for disability from silicosis or asbestosis of less than thirty-three and one-third percent (331/3%) of the total disability.  (d)(1) In case of disability or death from silicosis or asbestosis complicated with tuberculosis of the lungs, compensation shall be payable as for uncomplicated silicosis or asbestosis, provided that the silicosis or asbestosis was an essential factor in the causing of disability or death.  (2) In case of disability or death from silicosis or asbestosis complicated with any other disease, or from any other disease complicated with silicosis or asbestosis, the compensation shall be reduced as provided in Â§ 11-9-601(c).  (e)(1)(A)(i) Where an employee, though not actually disabled, is found by the Workers' Compensation Commission to be affected by silicosis or asbestosis to such a degree as to make it unduly hazardous for him or her to continue in an employment involving exposure to the hazards of the disease, the commission may order that he or she be removed from his or her employment. In such a case, or in case he or she has already been discharged from the employment and is unemployed, he or she shall be entitled to compensation until he or she can obtain steady employment in some other suitable occupation in which there are no hazards of the disease.  (ii) However, the compensation shall in no case be payable for longer than twenty-six (26) weeks immediately following the date of removal or discharge and unless application for compensation is made within the period.  (B) In case the employee obtains other suitable employment at reduced wages, the payments of compensation during such part of the twenty-six (26) week period as he or she is so employed shall be at the rate prescribed in Â§ 11-9-520.  (2)(A) When in any case the forced change of employment shall, in the opinion of the commission, require that the employee be given special training in order to fit him or her for another occupation, the employer liable for compensation shall pay for the training and incidental traveling expenses an additional sum, in no case, however, to exceed four hundred dollars ($400).  (B) The payment shall be made for the benefit of the employee to such person as the commission shall direct.  (C) No payment, however, shall be made unless the employee accepts the special training directed by the commission, nor shall payment be made for a longer period than the employee submits to the training.  (3) If an employee has been compensated, whether specially trained or not, and thereafter engages in any occupation which exposes him or her to hazards of silicosis or asbestosis without first having obtained the written approval of the commission, neither he or she, his or her dependents, personal representative, nor any other person shall be entitled to compensation or damages for his or her disablement or death from either of the diseases.  (4) However, neither a claim for nor receipt of compensation or benefits under this subsection shall bar the employee from any right to compensation for actual disability from silicosis or asbestosis if the disability results not later and within the time limited in Â§ 11-9-601(g).

===================================================================



 

  11-9-603. Practice and procedure.  (a)(1) Except as otherwise provided in this subchapter, procedure with respect to notice of disability or death and as to the filing of claims and determination of claims shall be the same as in cases of accidental injury or death.  (2)(A) Written notice shall be given to the employer of an occupational disease by the employee, or someone in his or her behalf, within ninety (90) days after the first distinct manifestation thereof.  (B) In the case of death from an occupational disease, written notice of death shall also be given to the employer within ninety (90) days thereafter.  (b) An award or denial of award of compensation for an occupational disease may be reviewed and compensation increased, reduced, or terminated where previously awarded, or awarded where previously denied, only upon proof of fraud or undue influence or of change of condition, and then only upon application by a party in interest made not later than one (1) year after the denial of award or, where compensation has been awarded, after the award or the date when the last payment was made under the award, except in cases of silicosis or asbestosis, where the time limit shall be two (2) years.

===================================================================



 

 11-9-701. Notice of injury or death.  (a)(1) Unless an injury either renders the employee physically or mentally unable to do so, or is made known to the employer immediately after it occurs, the employee shall report the injury to the employer on a form prescribed or approved by the Workers' Compensation Commission and to a person or at a place specified by the employer, and the employer shall not be responsible for disability, medical, or other benefits prior to receipt of the employee's report of injury.  (2) All reporting procedures specified by the employer must be reasonable and shall afford each employee reasonable notice of the reporting requirements.  (3) The foregoing shall not apply when an employee requires emergency medical treatment outside the employer's normal business hours; however, in that event, the employee shall cause a report of the injury to be made to the employer on the employer's next regular business day.  (b)(1) Failure to give the notice shall not bar any claim:  (A) If the employer had knowledge of the injury or death;  (B) If the employee had no knowledge that the condition or disease arose out of and in the course of the employment; or  (C) If the commission excuses the failure on the grounds that for some satisfactory reason the notice could not be given.  (2) Objection to failure to give notice must be made at or before the first hearing on the claim.

===================================================================



 

  11-9-702. Filing of claims.  (a) Time for Filing.  (1) A claim for compensation for disability on account of an injury, other than an occupational disease and occupational infection, shall be barred unless filed with the Workers' Compensation Commission within two (2) years from the date of the compensable injury. If, during the two-year period following the filing of the claim, the claimant receives no weekly benefit compensation and receives no medical treatment resulting from the alleged injury, the claim shall be barred thereafter.  (B) For purposes of this section, the date of the compensable injury shall be defined as the date an injury is caused by an accident as set forth in Â§ 11-9-102(4).  (2) A claim for compensation for disability on account of injury which is either an occupational disease or occupational infection shall be barred unless filed with the commission within two (2) years from the date of the last injurious exposure to the hazards of the disease or infection.  (A) However, a claim for compensation for disability on account of silicosis or asbestosis must be filed with the commission within one (1) year after the time of disablement, and the disablement must occur within three (3) years from the date of the last injurious exposure to the hazard of silicosis or asbestosis.  (B) Also, a claim for compensation for disability on account of a disease condition caused by exposure to X rays, radioactive substances, or ionizing radiation only must be filed with the commission within two (2) years from the date the condition is made known to an employee following examination and diagnosis by a medical doctor.  (3) A claim for compensation on account of death shall be barred unless filed with the commission within two (2) years of the date of such death.  (4) If, within six (6) months after the filing of a claim for compensation, no bona fide request for a hearing has been made with respect to the claim, the claim may, upon motion and after hearing, be dismissed without prejudice to the refiling of the claim within limitation periods specified in subdivisions (a)(1)-(3) of this section.  (b) Time for Filing Additional Compensation. (1) In cases where any compensation, including disability or medical, has been paid on account of injury, a claim for additional compensation shall be barred unless filed with the commission within one (1) year from the date of the last payment of compensation or two (2) years from the date of the injury, whichever is greater.  (2) The time limitations of this subsection shall not apply to claims for the replacement of medicine, crutches, ambulatory devices, artificial limbs, eyeglasses, contact lenses, hearing aids, and other apparatus permanently or indefinitely required as the result of a compensable injury, where the employer or carrier previously furnished such medical supplies, but replacement of such items shall not constitute payment of compensation so as to toll the running of the statute of limitations.  (c) A claim for additional compensation must specifically state that it is a claim for additional compensation. Documents which do not specifically request additional benefits shall not be considered a claim for additional compensation.  (d) If, within six (6) months after the filing of a claim for additional compensation, no bona fide request for a hearing has been made with respect to the claim, the claim may, upon motion and after hearing, if necessary, be dismissed without prejudice to the refiling of the claim within the limitation period specified in subsection (b) of this section.  (e) Failure to File. Failure to file a claim within the period prescribed in subsection (a) or (b) of this section shall not be a bar to the right unless objection to the failure is made at the first hearing on the claim in which all parties in interest have been given a reasonable notice and opportunity to be heard.  (f) Persons under Disability. (1) Notwithstanding any statute of limitation provided for in this chapter, when it is established that failure to file a claim by an injured employee or his or her dependents was induced by fraud, the claim may be filed within one (1) year from the time of the discovery of the fraud.  (2) The provisions of subsection (a) or (b) of this section shall not apply to a mental incompetent or minor so long as the person has no guardian or similar legal representative. The limitations prescribed in subsection (a) or (b) of this section shall apply to the mental incompetent or minor from the date of the appointment of a guardian or similar legal representative for that person, and where no guardian or similar representative has been appointed, to a minor upon obtainment of majority.  (g)(1) A latent injury or condition shall not delay or toll the limitation periods specified in this section.  (2) However, this subsection shall not apply to the limitation period for occupational diseases specified in subdivision (a)(2) of this section.  (h)(1) The purpose of this section is to provide for a timely hearing on claims for benefits.  (2) The purpose and intent of this section also includes the annulment of any and all case law inconsistent herewith.

 11-9-703. Preliminary conference procedure.  The Workers' Compensation Commission is authorized and directed to promulgate appropriate rules and regulations to establish and implement, for claims with respect to injuries occurring on or after January 1, 1987, a preliminary conference procedure designed to accomplish the following objectives:  (1) To provide the claimant an opportunity to confer with a legal advisor on the staff of the commission to be advised of his or her rights under this chapter and to ensure that the rights are protected. The conference shall be held in the county where the accident occurred, if the accident occurred in this state, unless otherwise agreed to between the parties, or otherwise directed by the commission;  (2) To provide an opportunity for, but not to compel, a binding settlement of some or all the issues present at the time;  (3) To facilitate the resolution of issues without the expense of litigation or attorney's fees for either party;  (4)(A)(i) To authorize the legal advisor to approve compromise settlements entered into at or as a result of the preliminary conference and those joint petition settlements entered into pursuant to Â§ 11-9-805.  (ii) Provided, however, the same legal advisors shall not both advise the claimant and approve the joint petition.  (B) The purpose and intent of this section is to affirm the duty of the commission to provide legal assistance, thereby reducing litigation and workers' compensation costs; and  (5) No moneys appropriated by Act 1046 of 1987 or any other act shall be expended to fund preliminary conferences held pursuant to Â§ 11-9-102, 11-9-205, 11-9-501 - 11-9-503, 11-9-517, 11-9-521, 11-9-522, 11-9-527, 11-9-701 - 11-9-704, 11-9-715, 11-9-802, or 11-9-804, other than in the county where the accident occurred, if the accident occurred in this state, the county of the claimant's residence, or such other county as agreed to by the parties.

(a)(1) Whenever the Workers' Compensation Commission determines that it is for the best interest of the parties entitled to compensation, and after due notice to all parties in interest of a hearing, the liability of the employer for compensation may be discharged by the payment of a lump sum equal to the present value of all future payments of compensation computed at ten percent (10%) discount, compounded annually.  (2) Lump-sum settlements shall not be allowed if the employer presents evidence which proves by a preponderance of the evidence that ordering the compensation discharged in such a manner would result in a substantial adverse effect on the continuing economic viability of the employer.  (b)(1) The probability of the death of the injured employee or other persons entitled to compensation before the expiration of the period during which they are entitled to compensation shall, in the absence of special circumstances making such a course improper, be determined in accordance with the following table.  (2) It is intended that this table shall be used in conjunction with the discount rate prescribed in subsection (a)(1) of this section for the purpose of calculating the present value of lump-sum settlements to injured employees.    ----------------------------------------        Average   Age     Remaining        Lifetime  Years     Years ----------------------------------------   1      74.97   2      75.37   3      74.47   4      73.54   5      72.59   6      71.63   7      70.67   8      69.70   9      68.73   10      67.75   11      66.77   12      65.80   13      64.82   14      63.84   15      62.87   16      61.90   17      60.94   18      59.97   19      59.02   20      58.06   21      57.10   22      56.15   23      55.19   24      54.24   25      53.29   26      52.33   27      51.38   28      50.42   29      49.47   30      48.52   31      47.57   32      46.62   33      45.68   34      44.73   35      43.79   36      42.86   37      41.92   38      40.66   39      40.07   40      39.14   41      38.23   42      37.31   43      36.41   44      35.50   45      34.60   46      33.71   47      32.83   48      31.95   49      31.08   50      30.21   51      29.35   52      28.49   53      27.65   54      26.80   55      25.97   56      25.14   57      24.31   58      23.49   59      22.68   60      21.88   61      21.09   62      20.30   63      19.53   64      18.76   65      18.00   66      17.25   67      16.51   68      15.78   69      15.06   70      14.35   71      13.67   72      13.01   73      12.38   74      11.77   75      11.18   76      10.61   77      10.04   78      9.48   79      8.93   80      8.40   81      7.90   82      7.42   83      6.98   84      6.57   85      6.17   86      5.80   87      5.43   88      5.09   89      4.77   90      4.47   91      4.18   92      3.92   93      3.69   94      3.50   95      3.33   96      3.18   97      3.06   98      2.95   99      2.85  100      2.77   (c) The probability of the happening of any other contingency affecting the amount or duration of compensation shall be disregarded, except the possibility of the remarriage of the widow, which shall be determined in accordance with the Danish Annuity and Dutch Remarriage Table.

(b)(1) If the commission decides it is for the best interests of the claimant that a final award be made, it may order an award that shall be final as to the rights of all parties to the petition.  (2) Thereafter, the commission shall not have jurisdiction over any claim for the same injury or any results arising from it.

(a)(1) Upon approval by the Insurance Commissioner, and following the adoption of such rules and regulations as the Insurance Commissioner deems necessary and advisable, each insurer issuing a policy under this chapter shall offer, as a part of the policy or as an optional endorsement to the policy, deductibles optional to the policyholder for benefits payable under this chapter.  (2) Deductible amounts offered shall be fully disclosed to the prospective policyholder in writing in the amount of one hundred dollars ($100), two hundred dollars ($200), three hundred dollars ($300), four hundred dollars ($400), and five hundred dollars ($500), or increments of five hundred dollars ($500), up to a maximum of two thousand five hundred dollars ($2,500) per compensable claim, or in such other amounts as may be set by the Insurance Commissioner.  (3) The policyholder exercising the deductible option shall choose only one (1) deductible amount.  (b) Optional deductibles shall be offered in each policy insuring liability for workers' compensation that is issued, delivered, issued for delivery, or renewed under this chapter on or after approval by the Insurance Commissioner, unless an insured employer and insurer agree to renegotiate a workers' compensation policy in effect on that date so as to include a provision allowing for a deductible.  (c)(1) If the policyholder exercises the option and chooses a deductible, the insured employer shall be liable for the amount of the deductible for benefits paid for each compensable claim of work injury suffered by an employee.  (2) The insurer shall pay all or part of the deductible amount, whichever is applicable to a compensable claim, to the person or medical provider entitled to the benefits conferred by this chapter and then seek reimbursement from the insured employer for the applicable deductible amount.  (3) The payment or nonpayment of deductible amounts by the insured employer to the insurer shall be treated under the policy insuring the liability for workers' compensation in the same manner as payment or nonpayment of premiums.  (d) If the Insurance Commissioner determines it to be feasible, and under such rules and regulations as he or she may adopt, premium reduction for deductibles may be determined before the application of any experience modification, premium surcharge, or premium discounts, and, to the extent that an employer's experience rating or safety record is based on benefits paid, money paid by the insured employer under a deductible as provided in this section may not be included as benefits paid so as to harm the experience rating of the employer.  (e) This section shall not apply to employers who are approved to self-insure against liability for workers' compensation or group self-insurance funds for workers' compensation.

(b) The Workers' Compensation Commission shall assess all workers' compensation self-insurers in an amount determined by each corporation, and the commission shall transmit the moneys collected to each corporation to be used solely to make workers' compensation benefit payments from each fund and to defray the expenses of each fund.

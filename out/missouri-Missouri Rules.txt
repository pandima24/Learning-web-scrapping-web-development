Rule action noticevalidating subsection (2)(C) Aug. 28, 1998.*Original authority: 286.060, RSMo 1945, amended1947, 1980.Farm v. Barlow Truck Lines Inc., 979 SW2d169 (Mo. banc 1998)State ex rel. Doe Run Company v. Brown,918 SW 2d 303 (Mo App. 1996). An administrativelaw judge set aside a dismissal of aclaim for workers compensation. The claimhad been dismissed for the failure to prosecute.A regulation promulgated by the Laborand Industrial Relation Commission, 8 CSR20-3.010(2)(C), implied that an administrativelaw judge had authority to change ormodify any final award within twenty days.Twenty days is the period of time in which tofile an application for review with the Laborand Industrial Relations Commission. TheDoe Run Company (employer) filed a petitionfor writ of prohibition of mandamus in circuitcourt, challenging the administrative lawjudges authority to set aside the dismissal ofthe claim for compensation. A permanentorder in prohibition was denied by the circuitcourt and the employer sought review in theappellate court.The Missouri Court of Appeals, Eastern District,said that section 287.610.2, RSMo(1994), provides an administrative law judgewith no jurisdiction to review or authority toreopen any prior award. Another statute, section287.655, RSMo (1994), provides that anorder of dismissal for lack of prosecution isan award, subject to review the same as anyother award. The appellate court held thatthe proper avenue for review of an order ofdismissal for failure to prosecute is by filingan application for review with the Labor andIndustrial Relations Commission within twentydays of the date of the dismissal. Section287.480, RSMo (1994). The administrativelaw judge was without jurisdiction to reinstatethe employees compensation claimagainst the employer. To the extent that 8CSR 20-3.010(2)(C) is interpreted as grantingan administrative law judge with authority toreinstate a dismissed workers compensationclaim within twenty days of a dismissal order,the rule conflicts with section 287.610.2,RSMo (1994), and is invalid.Cowick v. Gibbs Beauty Supplies, 430 SW2d626 (Mo. App. 1968). Court of Appeals limitedin review of award of Industrial Commissionconcerning workers compensationclaim to a determination of whether theaward was supported by competent and substantialevidence and whether an award couldhave reasonably been made upon a considerationof all of the evidence. The commissionis the sole judge of the credibility of witnessesand the weight to be given to their testimony.Collins v. Eicher Heating Company, 319SW2d 666 (Mo. App. 1959). Application forreview by the full Industrial Commission filedby insurer and employer on form prepared byand furnished by the Industrial Commissionand setting forth specific findings of administrativelaw judge appealed from, a request forpermission to argue the case orally before thefull commission because of conflicting medicalevaluation of record, requesting the commissionto appoint a qualified impartialphysician to examine the employer and reporthis/her findings, court held to be in substantialcompliance with the rules of the commissionconcerning applications for review; andtherefore commission had jurisdiction toreview the findings and award of the administrativelaw judge.Hogue v. Wurdack, 298 SW2d 492 (Mo.App. 1957). Industrial Commission is a creatureof the legislature, and its jurisdiction andthe question of what persons are subject to itis to be determined from the act of legislature.Commissions jurisdiction cannot bedependent on or enlarged by estoppel, waiver,conduct or agreement.E.B. Jones Motor Company v. IndustrialCommission, Division of Employment Secu-rity, 298 SW2d 411 (1957). Industrial Commissionof Missouri is an entity subject tobeing sued in its official name; however, it isnot a state officer within the meaning of theconstitutional provision, Art. V, Section 3,Constitution of Missouri; thus, SupremeCourt did not have jurisdiction of an appealfrom decision of the commission, because ofthe absence of a state officer as a party.Employment Security Law is not a revenuelaw.

===================================================================



 

8 CSR 20-1.010 The Labor and Industrial
Relations Commission
PURPOSE: This rule describes the organization
of the commission.
The Labor and Industrial Relations
Commission (commission) is in charge of the
department (Missouri Constitution, Article
IV, Section 49) and is composed of three (3)
members appointed by the governor with the
consent of the senate. One (1) member of the
commission who, by reason of his/her previous
activities and interests and who is
licensed to practice law in Missouri, shall
represent the public. Another member on
account of his/her previous vocation, employment,
affiliation or interests shall be classified
as a representative of the employer. The
remaining member on account of his/her previous
vocation, employment, affiliation or
interests shall be classified as a representative
of the employee. A member of the commission
is designated by the governor as chairman.
AUTHORITY: section 286.010, RSMo 1986.*
Original rule filed Dec. 18, 1975, effective
Dec. 28, 1975.
*Original authority: 286.010, RSMo 1945, amended 1995.
State ex inf. Danforth v. Butler, 524 SW2d1
(1975). The Omnibus State Reorganization
Act of 1974 did not abolish the Industrial
Commission, in fact, but was ï¿½abolishedï¿½
only as related to the transfer of duties, powers
and functions of office to the Labor and
Industrial Relations Commission. Provisions
that members of Industrial Commission succeed
to membership as Labor and Industrial
Relations Commission was not unconstitutional
as conflicting with constitutional powers
of governor, as order by Reorganization
Act of 1974.
Graphenreed v. Ford Motor Company, 482
SW2d68 (Mo. App. 1972). Where a final
award affirming a referee's decisions was
properly signed by two commissioners, this
constituted a quorum or majority as required
by section 286.010, RSMo (1969). Similarly
the order denying the motion to vacate was
properly signed by two members thus constituting
a majority. The award and order were

(The percentages are for unilateral losses unless otherwise noted) 
Disability Approximate Rating Not to Exceed 
Traumatic Cataract: When a traumatic cataract has been successfully treated by surgical or medical
methods, the best visual acuity for that eye with ophthalmic lenses
shall be measured. Fifty percent (50%) of this best visual acuity
efficiency with an ophthalmic lens shall represent the central visual
acuity efficiency of the eye for rating purposes. 
Dislocation
of Lens-Traumatic: Partial-Withhold rating for 12 months; then rate as
visual loss plus 50% (not to exceed 100%). Total-The loss shall be 100%
unless the lens has been successfully removed by surgery or has been
absorbed. When the lens has been successfully removed by surgery or has
been absorbed, the eye shall be rated as an eye where a traumatic
cataract has been removed. See: Traumatic Cataract preceding.

In the event of bilateral disabilities due to paralysis of
accommodation, loss of eye brows, loss of eye lashes, symblepharon,
ectropion, entripion, lagophthalmus or epiphora, the percentage of
unilateral loss in the poorer eye shall be taken of 140 weeks and to
that shall be added the percentage of unilateral loss in the better eye
taken of 260 weeks. (See section (9) for computation of binocular

===================================================================



 

8 CSR 50-5.060 Evaluation of Hearing DisabilityPURPOSE: The purpose of this rule is to establish the procedures to evaluate hearing disability, setting forth methods for its measurement and calculation.(1) The following are definitions relating to this matter and rule: (A) Hearing loss-the general condition of reduced auditory sensitivity; (B) Loss of hearing or threshold shift-a change for the worse in auditory sensitivity; (C) Threshold-the weakest sound that can be heard; (D) Decibel (dB)-a unit conventionally used to measure the magnitude of sound. In the testing of hearing, it is used to measure the threshold of a listener relative to the standard threshold (U.S. audiometers); (E) Audiometer-a device for the measurement of the threshold of hearing in decibels relative to a standard; (F) Hearing level or hearing threshold level-the reading on an audiometer in decibels corresponding to the threshold of hearing of the individual being tested; (G) Frequency-the number of regular fluctuations made by a sound wave in one (1) second; (H) Cycle-one (1) of a repeated series of regular fluctuations made by a sound wave; (I) Audiogram-a chart showing hearing levels at different frequencies; (J) Hearing disability or disability of hearing-a malfunction or abnormality of hearing of sufficient severity to constitute a practical handicap such as would justify compensation; particularly a reduction of efficiency in everyday communication by speech; (K) Deafness-term reserved to designate very severe or total disability of hearing; (L) Presbycusis-a loss of hearing occasioned by the aging process; and (M) Hearing level is a technical term that refers to the point (or threshold) in decibels when a testing sound is first detected by the listener. The lowest hearing level, therefore, represents best hearing not worst hearing. The lowest measured loss, therefore, is reflected by the lowest decibel rating at which the listener heard the test tone. (2) Weeks of compensation for hearing loss due to a traumatic incident (that is, a single accident such as an explosion, a blast or a blow on the head) shall be those provided in items 27 and 28 of subsection 1 of section 287.190, RSMo. (Complete deafness of both ears-one-hundred eight (180) weeks; complete deafness of one (1) ear, the other being normal-forty-nine (49) weeks.) (3) Weeks of compensation for hearing loss due to prolonged exposure to harmful noise in employment (that is, an occupational disease) shall be those provided in subsection 3 of section 287.197, RSMo. (4) Traumatic occupational hearing loss(es) shall be measured as prescribed in section 287.197, RSMo and this rule. (5) When both ears show hearing disability, the computation of disability shall be on the basis of binaural loss as provided in subsection 5 of section 287.197, RSMo. (6) Liability for occupational hearing loss occurs only when an employee has been exposed to the hazard of such loss for a period of ninety (90) days or longer and the loss becomes exclusively that of the employer in whose employment such exposure took place. (7) Each employer is liable for all of the occupational hearing loss to which his/her employment contributed, subject to the limitations of the measurement of hearing loss provisions, but no employer is liable for hearing loss sustained prior to employment with him/her nor for any hearing loss for which compensation previously was awarded or paid (section 287.197.8). (8) The date of disability of occupational hearing loss is the last day of a one (1)-month period following separation from the employment in which the employee was exposed to harmful noise (section 287.197.7). (9) Claim for compensation for occupational hearing loss, if maintained, must be made within two (2) years of the date of disability, as defined in section (8) of this rule. The provision of medical attention and/or the payment of compensation will toll the statute, as in other workers' compensation cases (section 287.197.7). (10) Only pure-tone air-conduction audiometric instruments that meet the standards calibrated to the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) occupational hearing loss reference level standards, including ANSI S 3.6, as referred to in section 287.197.2 shall be used for measuring hearing levels.(11) In the evaluation of hearing disability, only the hearing levels at the frequencies of five hundred (500), one thousand (1,000) and two thousand (2,000) cycles per second shall be considered; provided, however, that if a subject does not hear the test tone at the ninety-five (95) decibel hearing level in any or all of the three (3) frequencies, the value of one hundred (100) decibels shall be used for such frequency(ies) in calculating the average hearing level. (12) Three (3) separate audiograms, each on different days, shall be made including at least the frequencies of five hundred (500), one thousand (1,000) and two thousand (2,000) cycles per second and the lowest hearing level measured at each of the three (3) frequencies shall be used for the computation of hearing disability. The lowest hearing level at each of the three (3) frequencies shall be added together and the sum divided by three (3) to determine the average hearing level in decibels. If the audiograms show a lowest hearing level at any of these three (3) frequencies that is greater than one hundred (100) decibels, or else no response at all, the value of one hundred (100) dB shall be used for the level at such frequencies in calculating the average hearing level.(13) In order to allow for the average amount of hearing loss due to nonoccupational causes found in the population at any given age (including presbycusis), there shall be deducted from the average hearing level one-half (1/2) decibel for each year of the employee's age over forty (40) at the time of his/her audiogram. The result shall be termed the corrected average hearing level. (14) For every decibel that the corrected average hearing level exceeds twenty-six (26) decibels based on the ANSI reference levels, an allowance of one and one-half percent (1 1/2%) shall be made up to the maximum of one hundred percent (100%) which is reached at ninety-three (93) decibels based on the ANSI reference levels. The allowance thus calculated is the monaural percentage disability of hearing in that ear. (15) Binaural disability of hearing shall be determined by multiplying the percentage of disability in the better ear by five (5), to which result is added the percentage of disability in the poorer ear and dividing the sum of the two (2) by six (6). The result is the CODE OF STATE REGULATIONS (4/30/06) ROBIN CARNAHAN Secretary of Stateevaluation in percentage of binaural hearing disability.(16) No consideration shall be given to the question of whether or not the ability of an employee to understand speech is improved by the use of a hearing aid. (17) An employee may work in successive employments where s/he is exposed to harmful noise and sustain an accumulated hearing loss, only a part of which may be the liability of the last employer. Section 287.197.8, RSMo provides that an employer is liable only for the hearing loss to which his/her employment contributed. Each subsequent employer who hires an individual who already has some hearing disability is liable only for the additional disability that develops in its employment, subject to the correction according to age. (18) The best level of hearing at each of the three (3) frequencies of five hundred (500), one thousand (1,000) and two thousand (2,000) cycles per second is determined by selection from all available audiogram(s) made within six (6) months prior to or three (3) months after the date of employment. Earlier audiogram(s) may be used for this purpose only if none is available that were made during that nine (9)-month period. (19) The pre-employment average hearing level for the three (3) frequencies is calculated for each ear (section (12) of this rule). (20) The correction for nonoccupational hearing loss (section (13) of this rule) is applied by subtracting from the average hearing level for each ear one-half (1/2) decibel for each year of the employee's age over forty at the time of his/her audiogram.(21) If the corrected average hearing level of the pre-employment audiogram(s) in either ear exceeds twenty-six (26) decibels, the percentage of disability is calculated as in sections (14) and (15) of this rule. The employer is liable for the difference in percentage of disability between this value and the percentage of hearing disability calculated from post-employment hearing tests.

Subject to thediscretion of the division, an application canbe made on a CV-1 form reproduced fromelectronic means.(B) Formal claim will not be considered asfiled until the application form has been completedin its entirety and date-stamped by thedivision.(C) All communications, documents andletters shall be filed with this office.(D) All forms, reports, letters and otherdocuments filed by the claimant must be originaldocuments unless this requirement iswaived by the division.(E) The claimant shall be responsible forproving to the satisfaction of the division, bya preponderance of evidence, that the injuriesor death giving rise to the application arosefrom a crime which was promptly reported toa proper law enforcement agency; the extentof out-of-pocket losses sustained as a directresult of the crime; and that the victim, byhis/her acts, did not contribute to the injuriessuffered.(F) The claimant shall file with the divisioncurrent medical reports covering treatment,diagnosis and prognosis, including anestimate of any permanent injury impairingclaimant's ability to secure gainful employment.(G) Claimant shall produce legible identicalcopies of all bills and documents supportingthe payment of all unreimbursed expensesand wage losses or loss of support incurredunless this requirement is waived by the division.(H) Following the initial filing of a claim,if a claimant fails to take further steps to supportor perfect the claim as may be requiredby the division within thirty (30) days afterwritten notice of the requirement is sent bythe division to the claimant, the claimantshall be deemed in default. If the claimant isin default, the division shall notify theclaimant that the claim is denied and theclaimant shall be forever barred fromreasserting it; however, the division mayreopen the proceeding upon a showing by theclaimant that the failure to do the actsrequired by the division was beyond the controlof the claimant.(I) All communications from the divisionto the claimant will be sent to the claimant'slast known address. The claimant mustpromptly advise the division of any change inaddress in writing.(4) Death Cases.(A) The division may require an autopsyreport. Refusal to allow an autopsy may because for denial of benefits.(B) Claimant must file a Death Certificate.(C) Claimant must file a Birth Certificatefor each child for whom compensation issought as a dependent of the victim.(D) Claimant must provide documentableevidence of support when a claim is beingmade for loss of support.(E) The division may require federalincome tax returns indicating the claimant isa dependent of the victims.(5) Public Inspection of Documents.(A) A request to inspect or receive copiesof any document in the possession of the divisionas a result of a claim made under theCrime Victims Law shall be in writing.(B) The charge for copies shall be a reasonablecost determined by the division.(C) Persons inspecting documents shall notalter, deface or mark the documents in anymanner.(6) Suspension of Proceedings. The divisionmay suspend all proceedings pending dispositionof a criminal prosecution.(7) Reporting.(A) Victims shall promptly report thecrime to the proper authorities. No compensationshall be paid if the report shows thatsuch report was made more than forty-eight(48) hours after the occurrence or the discoveryof the crime upon which the claim isbased, unless the division finds that thereport was delayed because of the incapacityof the victim. A report made to the circuitcourt for the purpose of child or adult protectiveservices shall meet this requirement.In the discretion of the division, a reportmade to any state agency for the purposes ofchild or adult protective services may meetthis requirement.(B) A victim continually residing in a certifieddomestic violence shelter for up to five(5) days from the date of the crime may constitutegood cause for delay in reporting thecrime.(8) Cooperation.(A) Claimant shall cooperate with any lawenforcement agency investigating the crimegiving rise to the claim. Refusal to cooperatemay result in the denial of the claim.(B) All claimants must fully cooperate withinvestigators or representatives of the divisionin order to be eligible for an award. In theevent that cooperation is refused or denied,the division may deny a claim for lack ofcooperation.(9) Contribution.(A) Contribution is determined by theaction portrayed by the victim at the time ofor preceding the crime. If the victim participatedin an illegal act in which there was adirect relationship between the illegal act bythe victim and the infliction of the injuryupon which the claim is based, it will be consideredprima facie evidence of contributoryconduct and the claim shall be denied.(B) The actions of the victim in eventsleading up to the crime will be examined tofind if the victim was involved in an act inwhich there is a proximate relationshipbetween the victim's actions and the inflictionof the injuries to the victim. If a finding ismade that the victim's actions attributed tothe infliction of the injuries for which theclaim is based, then the amount of the awardwill be reduced or the claim will be denied.The division shall disregard the responsibilityof the victim for his/her own injury wherethe victim was provoked by the defendant inRebecca McDowell Cook (12/31/99) CODE OF STATE REGULATIONS 3Secretary of StateChapter 6-Crime Victims 8 CSR 50-6a manner threatening bodily harm to the victimand the victim acted in self-defense, orwhere responsibility was attributable toefforts by the victim to aid a victim or to preventa crime or an attempted crime fromoccurring in his/her presence or to apprehenda person who had committed a crime inhis/her presence.(10) Unjust Enrichment.(A) In determining whether a compensationaward can be made without unjustlyenriching an offender, the division shall evaluatewhether the victim has reported thecrime and is cooperating with the criminaljustice system in the investigation and prosecutionof the crime, and whether the victimwill do what is possible to prevent access bythe offender to compensation paid to the victim.If the victim is cooperating fully and ifthe offender will not benefit from or haveaccess to a substantial portion of any cashaward made by the division to the victim,then the award shall not be denied on thebasis that the offender would be unjustlyenriched.(B) An unjust enrichment determinationshall not be based solely on the presence ofthe offender in the household at the time ofthe award. The presence of the offender in thehousehold is only one factor to be consideredin determining unjust enrichment, and it isnecessary to make a case-by-case determinationof whether the offender will be unjustlyenriched, according to the facts of each situation.(C) In determining whether enrichment issubstantial or inconsequential, factors to beconsidered include the amount of the awardand whether a substantial portion of the compensationaward will be used directly by or onbehalf of the offender. If the offender hasdirect access to a cash award and/or if a substantialportion of it will be used to pay forhis/her living expenses, that portion of theaward that will substantially benefit theoffender may be reduced or denied. Whenenrichment is inconsequential or minimal,the award shall not be reduced or denied. Itshould be remembered, however, that a portionof an award that may pay for some of theoffender's living expenses, such as rent, mayalso be paying for the same essential needs ofthe victim and the victim's dependents.(D) The Crime Victim's CompensationFund is a payor of last resort. Collateralresources available to the victim from theoffender shall be examined. Collateralresources may include court-ordered restitution,an offending spouse's medical insuranceor other resources of the offender available tocover the victim's expenses. In evaluating theavailability of collateral resources, a determinationshall be made first as to whether theoffender has a legal responsibility to pay; second,whether the offender has resources topay; and third, whether payment is likely.The victim shall not be penalized for the failureof an offender to meet legal obligations topay for the costs of the victim's recovery. Ifthe offender fails to meet legal responsibilitiesto pay restitution or provide for the medicaland support needs of a spouse or child,or if the offender impeded payment of insurancethat may be available to cover a spouse'sor child's expenses, the division shouldattempt to meet the victim's needs to theextent allowed, and the division may pursuewhatever actions are appropriate to seekreimbursement from the offender. The divisionshall ensure that the program is subrogatedto any restitution the offender may oweto the victim.(E) Payments shall be made to third-partyproviders to prevent cash intended to pay forthe victim's expenses to be used by or onbehalf of the offender.(F) With regard to claims from or onbehalf of abused children, the division shallnot penalize child victims by denying ordelaying payment when the offender is notmeeting legal obligations or collateralresources are not forthcoming. Third-partypayments shall be used whenever possible toprevent or minimize unjust enrichment ofoffenders living with abused children. Thedivision may also consider establishment of atrust arrangement to guarantee that the awardis used for the purposes it is intended.(G) Life insurance proceeds shall not beconsidered a collateral source for a claim forloss of support.(H) A dependent, a family member or survivorof a victim of homicide shall not bedenied compensation on the basis of thehomicide victim being finally adjudicated andfound guilty in a criminal prosecution underthe laws of this state of two (2) felonies withinthe past ten (10) years, of which one (1) orboth involves illegal drugs or violence.(11) Award.(A) All awards shall be one (1)-time payments,including payments made for medicalcare or other services necessary as a result ofthe injury, with the exception, at the discretionof the division, of mental health treatmentor extended medical treatment whichmay be made in multiple payments;(B) When disbursing an award, the divisionshall apply the proceeds of the award in thefollowing order:1. Reimbursement for compensable outof-pocket expenses;2. Loss of income from gainful employmentthe victim would have earned had thevictim not been injured;3. Loss of financial support from gainfulemployment that the victim would havesupplied to legal dependents had the victimnot died; and4. Outstanding medical and funeralexpenses.(C) The division shall prorate the remainingamount of the award among the providersin category (11)(B)4. after compensationawarded outlined in paragraphs (11)(B)1., 2.and 3. have been deducted.(D) If the recipient of an award is a minor,the division may require that a guardianshipbe established and the award be delivered tothe guardian of the minor's estate. In noinstance shall payments be made directly toany person legally incompetent to receivethem but instead shall be made to the parent,guardian or conservator for the benefit ofsuch incapacitated person.(E) In determining whether to award lossof income from gainful employment to a victimor loss of support from gainful employmentto a dependent of a victim, the followingfactors may be considered by the division:1. Whether the victim was gainfullyemployed at the time of the injury or death asshown by federal and state income taxreturns; and2. If the victim was self-employed, federalincome tax returns and any estimatedreturns for the year of the crime.(F) In no case will an award for loss ofincome or loss of support from gainfulemployment be made without substantialproof of earnings at the time of the crime onwhich the claim is based.(G) The division will make an emergencyaward only upon a showing of dire necessity.The claimant must request, in writing, anemergency award when submitting his/herapplication form and show just cause as towhy an emergency award should be considered.No award will be made until the policereport is acquired.(H) The division shall not be liable forpayment of compensation for any out-ofpocketexpenses incurred more than three (3)years following the date of the crime.(12) Claim Filed.(A) Upon receipt of an Application forCompensation on Form CV-1, the divisionwill assign the case for investigation.(B) After the investigation is completedand necessary documents are filed, the divisionmay issue an administrative decisionoffering a settlement based upon its opinionas to the dollar value of the claim or deny the4 CODE OF STATE REGULATIONS (12/31/99) Rebecca McDowell CookSecretary of State8 CSR 50-6-LABOR & IND.

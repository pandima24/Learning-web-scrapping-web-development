The term "child" means a child whom the deceased employee left surviving, including a posthumous child, a child legally adopted, a child whom the deceased employee was legally obligated to support or a child to whom the deceased employee stood in loco parentis. The term "children" means the plural of "child". The term "physically or mentally incapacitated child or children" means a child or children incapable of engaging in regular and substantial gainful employment.

Within 60 days after July 15, 1991, the employer shall pay into the Rate Adjustment Fund a sum equal to one half of 1% of all such compensation payments made from January 1, 1991 through June 30, 1991. Within 60 days after January 15 of 1992 and each subsequent year through 1996, the employer shall pay into the Rate Adjustment Fund a sum equal to one half of 1% of all such compensation payments made in the last 6 months of the preceding calendar year. Within 60 days after July 15 of 1992 and each subsequent year through 1995, the employer shall pay into the Rate Adjustment Fund a sum equal to one half of 1% of all such compensation payments made in the first 6 months of the same calendar year. Within 60 days after January 15 of 1997 and each subsequent year through 2005, the employer shall pay into the Rate Adjustment Fund a sum equal to threeâfourths of 1% of all such compensation payments made in the last 6 months of the preceding calendar year. Within 60 days after July 15 of 1996 and each subsequent year through 2004, the employer shall pay into the Rate Adjustment Fund a sum equal to threeâfourths of 1% of all such compensation payments made in the first 6 months of the same calendar year. Within 60 days after July 15 of 2005, the employer shall pay into the Rate Adjustment Fund a sum equal to 1% of such compensation payments made in the first 6 months of the same calendar year. Within 60 days after January 15 of 2006 and each subsequent year, the employer shall pay into the Rate Adjustment Fund a sum equal to 1.25% of such compensation payments made in the last 6 months of the preceding calendar year. Within 60 days after July 15 of 2006 and each subsequent year, the employer shall pay into the Rate Adjustment Fund a sum equal to 1.25% of such compensation payments made in the first 6 months of the same calendar year. The administrative costs of collecting assessments from employers for the Rate Adjustment Fund shall be paid from the Rate Adjustment Fund. The cost of an actuarial audit of the Fund shall be paid from the Rate Adjustment Fund. The State Treasurer is ex officio custodian of such Special Fund and the same shall be held and disbursed for the purposes hereinafter stated in paragraphs (f) and (g) of Section 8 upon the order of the Commission or of a competent court. The Rate Adjustment Fund shall be deposited the same as are State funds and any interest accruing thereon shall be added thereto every 6 months. It shall be subject to audit the same as State funds and accounts and shall be protected by the general bond given by the State Treasurer. It is considered always appropriated for the purposes of disbursements as provided in paragraphs (f) and (g) of Section 8 of this Act and shall be paid out and disbursed as therein provided and shall not at any time be appropriated or diverted to any other use or purpose. Within 5 days after the effective date of this amendatory Act of 1990, the Comptroller and the State Treasurer shall transfer $1,000,000 from the General Revenue Fund to the Rate Adjustment Fund. By February 15, 1991, the Comptroller and the State Treasurer shall transfer $1,000,000 from the Rate Adjustment Fund to the General Revenue Fund. The Comptroller and Treasurer are authorized to make transfers at the request of the Chairman up to a total of $19,000,000 from the Second Injury Fund, the General Revenue Fund, and the Workers' Compensation Benefit Trust Fund to the Rate Adjustment Fund to the extent that there is insufficient money in the Rate Adjustment Fund to pay claims and obligations. Amounts may be transferred from the General Revenue Fund only if the funds in the Second Injury Fund or the Workers' Compensation Benefit Trust Fund are insufficient to pay claims and obligations of the Rate Adjustment Fund. All amounts transferred from the Second Injury Fund, the General Revenue Fund, and the Workers' Compensation Benefit Trust Fund shall be repaid from the Rate Adjustment Fund within 270 days of a transfer, together with interest at the rate earned by moneys on deposit in the Fund or Funds from which the moneys were transferred. Upon a finding by the Commission, after reasonable notice and hearing, that any employer has willfully and knowingly failed to pay the proper amounts into the Second Injury Fund or the Rate Adjustment Fund required by this Section or if such payments are not made within the time periods prescribed by this Section, the employer shall, in addition to such payments, pay a penalty of 20% of the amount required to be paid or $2,500, whichever is greater, for each year or part thereof of such failure to pay. This penalty shall only apply to obligations of an employer to the Second Injury Fund or the Rate Adjustment Fund accruing after the effective date of this amendatory Act of 1989. All or part of such a penalty may be waived by the Commission for good cause shown. Any obligations of an employer to the Second Injury Fund and Rate Adjustment Fund accruing prior to the effective date of this amendatory Act of 1989 shall be paid in full by such employer within 5 years of the effective date of this amendatory Act of 1989, with at least oneâfifth of such obligation to be paid during each year following the effective date of this amendatory Act of 1989. If the Commission finds, following reasonable notice and hearing, that an employer has failed to make timely payment of any obligation accruing under the preceding sentence, the employer shall, in addition to all other payments required by this Section, be liable for a penalty equal to 20% of the overdue obligation or $2,500, whichever is greater, for each year or part thereof that obligation is overdue. All or part of such a penalty may be waived by the Commission for good cause shown. The Chairman of the Illinois Workers' Compensation Commission shall, annually, furnish to the Director of the Department of Insurance a list of the amounts paid into the Second Injury Fund and the Rate Adjustment Fund by each insurance company on behalf of their insured employers. The Director shall verify to the Chairman that the amounts paid by each insurance company are accurate as best as the Director can determine from the records available to the Director. The Chairman shall verify that the amounts paid by each selfâinsurer are accurate as best as the Chairman can determine from records available to the Chairman. The Chairman may require each selfâinsurer to provide information concerning the total compensation payments made upon which contributions to the Second Injury Fund and the Rate Adjustment Fund are predicated and any additional information establishing that such payments have been made into these funds. Any deficiencies in payments noted by the Director or Chairman shall be subject to the penalty provisions of this Act. The State Treasurer, or his duly authorized representative, shall be named as a party to all proceedings in all cases involving claim for the loss of, or the permanent and complete loss of the use of one eye, one foot, one leg, one arm or one hand. The State Treasurer or his duly authorized agent shall have the same rights as any other party to the proceeding, including the right to petition for review of any award. The reasonable expenses of litigation, such as medical examinations, testimony, and transcript of evidence, incurred by the State Treasurer or his duly authorized representative, shall be borne by the Second Injury Fund. If the award is not paid within 30 days after the date the award has become final, the Commission shall proceed to take judgment thereon in its own name as is provided for other awards by paragraph (g) of Section 19 of this Act and take the necessary steps to collect the award. Any person, corporation or organization who has paid or become liable for the payment of burial expenses of the deceased employee may in his or its own name institute proceedings before the Commission for the collection thereof. For the purpose of administration, receipts and disbursements, the Special Fund provided for in paragraph (f) of this Section shall be administered jointly with the Special Fund provided for in Section 7, paragraph (f) of the Workers' Occupational Diseases Act. (g) All compensation, except for burial expenses provided in this Section to be paid in case accident results in death, shall be paid in installments equal to the percentage of the average earnings as provided for in Section 8, paragraph (b) of this Act, at the same intervals at which the wages or earnings of the employees were paid. If this is not feasible, then the installments shall be paid weekly. Such compensation may be paid in a lump sum upon petition as provided in Section 9 of this Act. However, in addition to the benefits provided by Section 9 of this Act where compensation for death is payable to the deceased's widow, widower or to the deceased's widow, widower and one or more children, and where a partial lump sum is applied for by such beneficiary or beneficiaries within 18 months after the deceased's death, the Commission may, in its discretion, grant a partial lump sum of not to exceed 100 weeks of the compensation capitalized at their present value upon the basis of interest calculated at 3% per annum with annual rests, upon a showing that such partial lump sum is for the best interest of such beneficiary or beneficiaries. (h) In case the injured employee is under 16 years of age at the time of the accident and is illegally employed, the amount of compensation payable under paragraphs (a), (b), (c), (d) and (f) of this Section shall be increased 50%. Nothing herein contained repeals or amends the provisions of the Child Labor Law relating to the employment of minors under the age of 16 years. However, where an employer has on file an employment certificate issued pursuant to the Child Labor Law or work permit issued pursuant to the Federal Fair Labor Standards Act, as amended, or a birth certificate properly and duly issued, such certificate, permit or birth certificate is conclusive evidence as to the age of the injured minor employee for the purposes of this Section only. (i) Whenever the dependents of a deceased employee are aliens not residing in the United States, Mexico or Canada, the amount of compensation payable is limited to the beneficiaries described in paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) of this Section and is 50% of the compensation provided in paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) of this Section, except as otherwise provided by treaty. In a case where any of the persons who would be entitled to compensation is living at any place outside of the United States, then payment shall be made to the personal representative of the deceased employee. The distribution by such personal representative to the persons entitled shall be made to such persons and in such manner as the Commission orders.(Source: P.A. 93â721, eff. 1â1â05; 94â277, eff. 7â20â05; 94â695, eff. 11â16â05.)

===================================================================



 

 Sec. 8. The amount of compensation which shall be paid to the employee for an accidental injury not resulting in death is:
    (a) The employer shall provide and pay the negotiated rate, if applicable, or the lesser of the health care provider's actual charges or according to a fee schedule, subject to Section 8.2, in effect at the time the service was rendered for all the necessary first aid, medical and surgical services, and all necessary medical, surgical and hospital services thereafter incurred, limited, however, to that which is reasonably required to cure or relieve from the effects of the accidental injury, even if a health care provider sells, transfers, or otherwise assigns an account receivable for procedures, treatments, or services covered under this Act. If the employer does not dispute payment of first aid, medical, surgical, and hospital services, the employer shall make such payment to the provider on behalf of the employee. The employer shall also pay for treatment, instruction and training necessary for the physical, mental and vocational rehabilitation of the employee, including all maintenance costs and expenses incidental thereto. If as a result of the injury the employee is unable to be self-sufficient the employer shall further pay for such maintenance or institutional care as shall be required.
    The employee may at any time elect to secure his own physician, surgeon and hospital services at the employer's expense, or,
    Upon agreement between the employer and the employees, or the employees' exclusive representative, and subject to the approval of the Illinois Workers' Compensation Commission, the employer shall maintain a list of physicians, to be known as a Panel of Physicians, who are accessible to the employees. The employer shall post this list in a place or places easily accessible to his employees. The employee shall have the right to make an alternative choice of physician from such Panel if he is not satisfied with the physician first selected. If, due to the nature of the injury or its occurrence away from the employer's place of business, the employee is unable to make a selection from the Panel, the selection process from the Panel shall not apply. The physician selected from the Panel may arrange for any consultation, referral or other specialized medical services outside the Panel at the employer's expense. Provided that, in the event the Commission shall find that a doctor selected by the employee is rendering improper or inadequate care, the Commission may order the employee to select another doctor certified or qualified in the medical field for which treatment is required. If the employee refuses to make such change the Commission may relieve the employer of his obligation to pay the doctor's charges from the date of refusal to the date of compliance.
    Any vocational rehabilitation counselors who provide service under this Act shall have appropriate certifications which designate the counselor as qualified to render opinions relating to vocational rehabilitation. Vocational rehabilitation may include, but is not limited to, counseling for job searches, supervising a job search program, and vocational retraining including education at an accredited learning institution. The employee or employer may petition to the Commission to decide disputes relating to vocational rehabilitation and the Commission shall resolve any such dispute, including payment of the vocational rehabilitation program by the employer.
    The maintenance benefit shall not be less than the temporary total disability rate determined for the employee. In addition, maintenance shall include costs and expenses incidental to the vocational rehabilitation program.
    When the employee is working light duty on a part-time basis or full-time basis and earns less than he or she would be earning if employed in the full capacity of the job or jobs, then the employee shall be entitled to temporary partial disability benefits. Temporary partial disability benefits shall be equal to two-thirds of the difference between the average amount that the employee would be able to earn in the full performance of his or her duties in the occupation in which he or she was engaged at the time of accident and the gross amount which he or she is earning in the modified job provided to the employee by the employer or in any other job that the employee is working.
    Every hospital, physician, surgeon or other person rendering treatment or services in accordance with the provisions of this Section shall upon written request furnish full and complete reports thereof to, and permit their records to be copied by, the employer, the employee or his dependents, as the case may be, or any other party to any proceeding for compensation before the Commission, or their attorneys.
    Notwithstanding the foregoing, the employer's liability to pay for such medical services selected by the employee shall be limited to:
        (1) all first aid and emergency treatment; plus
        (2) all medical, surgical and hospital services
        
provided by the physician, surgeon or hospital initially chosen by the employee or by any other physician, consultant, expert, institution or other provider of services recommended by said initial service provider or any subsequent provider of medical services in the chain of referrals from said initial service provider; plus
        (3) all medical, surgical and hospital services
        
provided by any second physician, surgeon or hospital subsequently chosen by the employee or by any other physician, consultant, expert, institution or other provider of services recommended by said second service provider or any subsequent provider of medical services in the chain of referrals from said second service provider. Thereafter the employer shall select and pay for all necessary medical, surgical and hospital treatment and the employee may not select a provider of medical services at the employer's expense unless the employer agrees to such selection. At any time the employee may obtain any medical treatment he desires at his own expense. This paragraph shall not affect the duty to pay for rehabilitation referred to above.
        (4) The following shall apply for injuries occurring
        
on or after June 28, 2011 (the effective date of Public Act 97-18) and only when an employer has an approved preferred provider program pursuant to Section 8.1a on the date the employee sustained his or her accidental injuries:
            (A) The employer shall, in writing, on a form
            
promulgated by the Commission, inform the employee of the preferred provider program;
            (B) Subsequent to the report of an injury by an
            
employee, the employee may choose in writing at any time to decline the preferred provider program, in which case that would constitute one of the two choices of medical providers to which the employee is entitled under subsection (a)(2) or (a)(3); and
            (C) Prior to the report of an injury by an
            
employee, when an employee chooses non-emergency treatment from a provider not within the preferred provider program, that would constitute the employee's one choice of medical providers to which the employee is entitled under subsection (a)(2) or (a)(3).
    When an employer and employee so agree in writing, nothing in this Act prevents an employee whose injury or disability has been established under this Act, from relying in good faith, on treatment by prayer or spiritual means alone, in accordance with the tenets and practice of a recognized church or religious denomination, by a duly accredited practitioner thereof, and having nursing services appropriate therewith, without suffering loss or diminution of the compensation benefits under this Act. However, the employee shall submit to all physical examinations required by this Act. The cost of such treatment and nursing care shall be paid by the employee unless the employer agrees to make such payment.
    Where the accidental injury results in the amputation of an arm, hand, leg or foot, or the enucleation of an eye, or the loss of any of the natural teeth, the employer shall furnish an artificial of any such members lost or damaged in accidental injury arising out of and in the course of employment, and shall also furnish the necessary braces in all proper and necessary cases. In cases of the loss of a member or members by amputation, the employer shall, whenever necessary, maintain in good repair, refit or replace the artificial limbs during the lifetime of the employee. Where the accidental injury accompanied by physical injury results in damage to a denture, eye glasses or contact eye lenses, or where the accidental injury results in damage to an artificial member, the employer shall replace or repair such denture, glasses, lenses, or artificial member.
    The furnishing by the employer of any such services or appliances is not an admission of liability on the part of the employer to pay compensation.
    The furnishing of any such services or appliances or the servicing thereof by the employer is not the payment of compensation.
    (b) If the period of temporary total incapacity for work lasts more than 3 working days, weekly compensation as hereinafter provided shall be paid beginning on the 4th day of such temporary total incapacity and continuing as long as the total temporary incapacity lasts. In cases where the temporary total incapacity for work continues for a period of 14 days or more from the day of the accident compensation shall commence on the day after the accident.
        1. The compensation rate for temporary total
        
incapacity under this paragraph (b) of this Section shall be equal to 66 2/3% of the employee's average weekly wage computed in accordance with Section 10, provided that it shall be not less than 66 2/3% of the sum of the Federal minimum wage under the Fair Labor Standards Act, or the Illinois minimum wage under the Minimum Wage Law, whichever is more, multiplied by 40 hours. This percentage rate shall be increased by 10% for each spouse and child, not to exceed 100% of the total minimum wage calculation, nor exceed the employee's average weekly wage computed in accordance with the provisions of Section 10, whichever is less.
        2. The compensation rate in all cases other than for
        
temporary total disability under this paragraph (b), and other than for serious and permanent disfigurement under paragraph (c) and other than for permanent partial disability under subparagraph (2) of paragraph (d) or under paragraph (e), of this Section shall be equal to 66 2/3% of the employee's average weekly wage computed in accordance with the provisions of Section 10, provided that it shall be not less than 66 2/3% of the sum of the Federal minimum wage under the Fair Labor Standards Act, or the Illinois minimum wage under the Minimum Wage Law, whichever is more, multiplied by 40 hours. This percentage rate shall be increased by 10% for each spouse and child, not to exceed 100% of the total minimum wage calculation, nor exceed the employee's average weekly wage computed in accordance with the provisions of Section 10, whichever is less.
        2.1. The compensation rate in all cases of serious
        
and permanent disfigurement under paragraph (c) and of permanent partial disability under subparagraph (2) of paragraph (d) or under paragraph (e) of this Section shall be equal to 60% of the employee's average weekly wage computed in accordance with the provisions of Section 10, provided that it shall be not less than 66 2/3% of the sum of the Federal minimum wage under the Fair Labor Standards Act, or the Illinois minimum wage under the Minimum Wage Law, whichever is more, multiplied by 40 hours. This percentage rate shall be increased by 10% for each spouse and child, not to exceed 100% of the total minimum wage calculation, nor exceed the employee's average weekly wage computed in accordance with the provisions of Section 10, whichever is less.
        3. As used in this Section the term "child" means a
        
child of the employee including any child legally adopted before the accident or whom at the time of the accident the employee was under legal obligation to support or to whom the employee stood in loco parentis, and who at the time of the accident was under 18 years of age and not emancipated. The term "children" means the plural of "child".
        4. All weekly compensation rates provided under
        
subparagraphs 1, 2 and 2.1 of this paragraph (b) of this Section shall be subject to the following limitations:
        The maximum weekly compensation rate from July 1,
        
1975, except as hereinafter provided, shall be 100% of the State's average weekly wage in covered industries under the Unemployment Insurance Act, that being the wage that most closely approximates the State's average weekly wage.
        The maximum weekly compensation rate, for the period
        
July 1, 1984, through June 30, 1987, except as hereinafter provided, shall be $293.61. Effective July 1, 1987 and on July 1 of each year thereafter the maximum weekly compensation rate, except as hereinafter provided, shall be determined as follows: if during the preceding 12 month period there shall have been an increase in the State's average weekly wage in covered industries under the Unemployment Insurance Act, the weekly compensation rate shall be proportionately increased by the same percentage as the percentage of increase in the State's average weekly wage in covered industries under the Unemployment Insurance Act during such period.
        The maximum weekly compensation rate, for the period
        
January 1, 1981 through December 31, 1983, except as hereinafter provided, shall be 100% of the State's average weekly wage in covered industries under the Unemployment Insurance Act in effect on January 1, 1981. Effective January 1, 1984 and on January 1, of each year thereafter the maximum weekly compensation rate, except as hereinafter provided, shall be determined as follows: if during the preceding 12 month period there shall have been an increase in the State's average weekly wage in covered industries under the Unemployment Insurance Act, the weekly compensation rate shall be proportionately increased by the same percentage as the percentage of increase in the State's average weekly wage in covered industries under the Unemployment Insurance Act during such period.
        From July 1, 1977 and thereafter such maximum weekly
        
compensation rate in death cases under Section 7, and permanent total disability cases under paragraph (f) or subparagraph 18 of paragraph (3) of this Section and for temporary total disability under paragraph (b) of this Section and for amputation of a member or enucleation of an eye under paragraph (e) of this Section shall be increased to 133-1/3% of the State's average weekly wage in covered industries under the Unemployment Insurance Act.
        For injuries occurring on or after February 1, 2006,
        
the maximum weekly benefit under paragraph (d)1 of this Section shall be 100% of the State's average weekly wage in covered industries under the Unemployment Insurance Act.
        4.1. Any provision herein to the contrary
        
notwithstanding, the weekly compensation rate for compensation payments under subparagraph 18 of paragraph (e) of this Section and under paragraph (f) of this Section and under paragraph (a) of Section 7 and for amputation of a member or enucleation of an eye under paragraph (e) of this Section, shall in no event be less than 50% of the State's average weekly wage in covered industries under the Unemployment Insurance Act.
        4.2. Any provision to the contrary notwithstanding,
        
the total compensation payable under Section 7 shall not exceed the greater of $500,000 or 25 years.
        5. For the purpose of this Section this State's
        
average weekly wage in covered industries under the Unemployment Insurance Act on July 1, 1975 is hereby fixed at $228.16 per week and the computation of compensation rates shall be based on the aforesaid average weekly wage until modified as hereinafter provided.
        6. The Department of Employment Security of the State
        
shall on or before the first day of December, 1977, and on or before the first day of June, 1978, and on the first day of each December and June of each year thereafter, publish the State's average weekly wage in covered industries under the Unemployment Insurance Act and the Illinois Workers' Compensation Commission shall on the 15th day of January, 1978 and on the 15th day of July, 1978 and on the 15th day of each January and July of each year thereafter, post and publish the State's average weekly wage in covered industries under the Unemployment Insurance Act as last determined and published by the Department of Employment Security. The amount when so posted and published shall be conclusive and shall be applicable as the basis of computation of compensation rates until the next posting and publication as aforesaid.
        7. The payment of compensation by an employer or his
        
insurance carrier to an injured employee shall not constitute an admission of the employer's liability to pay compensation.
    (c) For any serious and permanent disfigurement to the hand, head, face, neck, arm, leg below the knee or the chest above the axillary line, the employee is entitled to compensation for such disfigurement, the amount determined by agreement at any time or by arbitration under this Act, at a hearing not less than 6 months after the date of the accidental injury, which amount shall not exceed 150 weeks (if the accidental injury occurs on or after the effective date of this amendatory Act of the 94th General Assembly but before February 1, 2006) or 162 weeks (if the accidental injury occurs on or after February 1, 2006) at the applicable rate provided in subparagraph 2.1 of paragraph (b) of this Section.
    No compensation is payable under this paragraph where compensation is payable under paragraphs (d), (e) or (f) of this Section.
    A duly appointed member of a fire department in a city, the population of which exceeds 500,000 according to the last federal or State census, is eligible for compensation under this paragraph only where such serious and permanent disfigurement results from burns.
    (d) 1. If, after the accidental injury has been sustained, the employee as a result thereof becomes partially incapacitated from pursuing his usual and customary line of employment, he shall, except in cases compensated under the specific schedule set forth in paragraph (e) of this Section, receive compensation for the duration of his disability, subject to the limitations as to maximum amounts fixed in paragraph (b) of this Section, equal to 66-2/3% of the difference between the average amount which he would be able to earn in the full performance of his duties in the occupation in which he was engaged at the time of the accident and the average amount which he is earning or is able to earn in some suitable employment or business after the accident. For accidental injuries that occur on or after September 1, 2011, an award for wage differential under this subsection shall be effective only until the employee reaches the age of 67 or 5 years from the date the award becomes final, whichever is later.
    2. If, as a result of the accident, the employee sustains serious and permanent injuries not covered by paragraphs (c) and (e) of this Section or having sustained injuries covered by the aforesaid paragraphs (c) and (e), he shall have sustained in addition thereto other injuries which injuries do not incapacitate him from pursuing the duties of his employment but which would disable him from pursuing other suitable occupations, or which have otherwise resulted in physical impairment; or if such injuries partially incapacitate him from pursuing the duties of his usual and customary line of employment but do not result in an impairment of earning capacity, or having resulted in an impairment of earning capacity, the employee elects to waive his right to recover under the foregoing subparagraph 1 of paragraph (d) of this Section then in any of the foregoing events, he shall receive in addition to compensation for temporary total disability under paragraph (b) of this Section, compensation at the rate provided in subparagraph 2.1 of paragraph (b) of this Section for that percentage of 500 weeks that the partial disability resulting from the injuries covered by this paragraph bears to total disability. If the employee shall have sustained a fracture of one or more vertebra or fracture of the skull, the amount of compensation allowed under this Section shall be not less than 6 weeks for a fractured skull and 6 weeks for each fractured vertebra, and in the event the employee shall have sustained a fracture of any of the following facial bones: nasal, lachrymal, vomer, zygoma, maxilla, palatine or mandible, the amount of compensation allowed under this Section shall be not less than 2 weeks for each such fractured bone, and for a fracture of each transverse process not less than 3 weeks. In the event such injuries shall result in the loss of a kidney, spleen or lung, the amount of compensation allowed under this Section shall be not less than 10 weeks for each such organ. Compensation awarded under this subparagraph 2 shall not take into consideration injuries covered under paragraphs (c) and (e) of this Section and the compensation provided in this paragraph shall not affect the employee's right to compensation payable under paragraphs (b), (c) and (e) of this Section for the disabilities therein covered.
    (e) For accidental injuries in the following schedule, the employee shall receive compensation for the period of temporary total incapacity for work resulting from such accidental injury, under subparagraph 1 of paragraph (b) of this Section, and shall receive in addition thereto compensation for a further period for the specific loss herein mentioned, but shall not receive any compensation under any other provisions of this Act. The following listed amounts apply to either the loss of or the permanent and complete loss of use of the member specified, such compensation for the length of time as follows:
        1. Thumb-

            162 weeks if the accidental injury occurs on or
            
after February 1, 2006.
        16. For the permanent partial loss of use of a member
        
or sight of an eye, or hearing of an ear, compensation during that proportion of the number of weeks in the foregoing schedule provided for the loss of such member or sight of an eye, or hearing of an ear, which the partial loss of use thereof bears to the total loss of use of such member, or sight of eye, or hearing of an ear.
            (a) Loss of hearing for compensation purposes
            
shall be confined to the frequencies of 1,000, 2,000 and 3,000 cycles per second. Loss of hearing ability for frequency tones above 3,000 cycles per second are not to be considered as constituting disability for hearing.
            (b) The percent of hearing loss, for purposes of
            
the determination of compensation claims for occupational deafness, shall be calculated as the average in decibels for the thresholds of hearing for the frequencies of 1,000, 2,000 and 3,000 cycles per second. Pure tone air conduction audiometric instruments, approved by nationally recognized authorities in this field, shall be used for measuring hearing loss. If the losses of hearing average 30 decibels or less in the 3 frequencies, such losses of hearing shall not then constitute any compensable hearing disability. If the losses of hearing average 85 decibels or more in the 3 frequencies, then the same shall constitute and be total or 100% compensable hearing loss.
            (c) In measuring hearing impairment, the lowest
            
measured losses in each of the 3 frequencies shall be added together and divided by 3 to determine the average decibel loss. For every decibel of loss exceeding 30 decibels an allowance of 1.82% shall be made up to the maximum of 100% which is reached at 85 decibels.
            (d) If a hearing loss is established to have
            
existed on July 1, 1975 by audiometric testing the employer shall not be liable for the previous loss so established nor shall he be liable for any loss for which compensation has been paid or awarded.
            (e) No consideration shall be given to the
            
question of whether or not the ability of an employee to understand speech is improved by the use of a hearing aid.
            (f) No claim for loss of hearing due to
            
industrial noise shall be brought against an employer or allowed unless the employee has been exposed for a period of time sufficient to cause permanent impairment to noise levels in excess of the following:
Sound Level DBA    
Slow Response    Hours Per Day
90    8
92    6
95    4
97    3
100    2
102    1-1/2
105    1
110    1/2
115    1/4
        This subparagraph (f) shall not be applied in cases
        
of hearing loss resulting from trauma or explosion.
        17. In computing the compensation to be paid to any
        
employee who, before the accident for which he claims compensation, had before that time sustained an injury resulting in the loss by amputation or partial loss by amputation of any member, including hand, arm, thumb or fingers, leg, foot or any toes, such loss or partial loss of any such member shall be deducted from any award made for the subsequent injury. For the permanent loss of use or the permanent partial loss of use of any such member or the partial loss of sight of an eye, for which compensation has been paid, then such loss shall be taken into consideration and deducted from any award for the subsequent injury.
        18. The specific case of loss of both hands, both
        
arms, or both feet, or both legs, or both eyes, or of any two thereof, or the permanent and complete loss of the use thereof, constitutes total and permanent disability, to be compensated according to the compensation fixed by paragraph (f) of this Section. These specific cases of total and permanent disability do not exclude other cases.
        Any employee who has previously suffered the loss or
        
permanent and complete loss of the use of any of such members, and in a subsequent independent accident loses another or suffers the permanent and complete loss of the use of any one of such members the employer for whom the injured employee is working at the time of the last independent accident is liable to pay compensation only for the loss or permanent and complete loss of the use of the member occasioned by the last independent accident.
        19. In a case of specific loss and the subsequent
        
death of such injured employee from other causes than such injury leaving a widow, widower, or dependents surviving before payment or payment in full for such injury, then the amount due for such injury is payable to the widow or widower and, if there be no widow or widower, then to such dependents, in the proportion which such dependency bears to total dependency.
    Beginning July 1, 1980, and every 6 months thereafter, the Commission shall examine the Second Injury Fund and when, after deducting all advances or loans made to such Fund, the amount therein is $500,000 then the amount required to be paid by employers pursuant to paragraph (f) of Section 7 shall be reduced by one-half. When the Second Injury Fund reaches the sum of $600,000 then the payments shall cease entirely. However, when the Second Injury Fund has been reduced to $400,000, payment of one-half of the amounts required by paragraph (f) of Section 7 shall be resumed, in the manner herein provided, and when the Second Injury Fund has been reduced to $300,000, payment of the full amounts required by paragraph (f) of Section 7 shall be resumed, in the manner herein provided. The Commission shall make the changes in payment effective by general order, and the changes in payment become immediately effective for all cases coming before the Commission thereafter either by settlement agreement or final order, irrespective of the date of the accidental injury.
    On August 1, 1996 and on February 1 and August 1 of each subsequent year, the Commission shall examine the special fund designated as the "Rate Adjustment Fund" and when, after deducting all advances or loans made to said fund, the amount therein is $4,000,000, the amount required to be paid by employers pursuant to paragraph (f) of Section 7 shall be reduced by one-half. When the Rate Adjustment Fund reaches the sum of $5,000,000 the payment therein shall cease entirely. However, when said Rate Adjustment Fund has been reduced to $3,000,000 the amounts required by paragraph (f) of Section 7 shall be resumed in the manner herein provided.
    (f) In case of complete disability, which renders the employee wholly and permanently incapable of work, or in the specific case of total and permanent disability as provided in subparagraph 18 of paragraph (e) of this Section, compensation shall be payable at the rate provided in subparagraph 2 of paragraph (b) of this Section for life.
    An employee entitled to benefits under paragraph (f) of this Section shall also be entitled to receive from the Rate Adjustment Fund provided in paragraph (f) of Section 7 of the supplementary benefits provided in paragraph (g) of this Section 8.
    If any employee who receives an award under this paragraph afterwards returns to work or is able to do so, and earns or is able to earn as much as before the accident, payments under such award shall cease. If such employee returns to work, or is able to do so, and earns or is able to earn part but not as much as before the accident, such award shall be modified so as to conform to an award under paragraph (d) of this Section. If such award is terminated or reduced under the provisions of this paragraph, such employees have the right at any time within 30 months after the date of such termination or reduction to file petition with the Commission for the purpose of determining whether any disability exists as a result of the original accidental injury and the extent thereof.
    Disability as enumerated in subdivision 18, paragraph (e) of this Section is considered complete disability.
    If an employee who had previously incurred loss or the permanent and complete loss of use of one member, through the loss or the permanent and complete loss of the use of one hand, one arm, one foot, one leg, or one eye, incurs permanent and complete disability through the loss or the permanent and complete loss of the use of another member, he shall receive, in addition to the compensation payable by the employer and after such payments have ceased, an amount from the Second Injury Fund provided for in paragraph (f) of Section 7, which, together with the compensation payable from the employer in whose employ he was when the last accidental injury was incurred, will equal the amount payable for permanent and complete disability as provided in this paragraph of this Section.
    The custodian of the Second Injury Fund provided for in paragraph (f) of Section 7 shall be joined with the employer as a party respondent in the application for adjustment of claim. The application for adjustment of claim shall state briefly and in general terms the approximate time and place and manner of the loss of the first member.
    In its award the Commission or the Arbitrator shall specifically find the amount the injured employee shall be weekly paid, the number of weeks compensation which shall be paid by the employer, the date upon which payments begin out of the Second Injury Fund provided for in paragraph (f) of Section 7 of this Act, the length of time the weekly payments continue, the date upon which the pension payments commence and the monthly amount of the payments. The Commission shall 30 days after the date upon which payments out of the Second Injury Fund have begun as provided in the award, and every month thereafter, prepare and submit to the State Comptroller a voucher for payment for all compensation accrued to that date at the rate fixed by the Commission. The State Comptroller shall draw a warrant to the injured employee along with a receipt to be executed by the injured employee and returned to the Commission. The endorsed warrant and receipt is a full and complete acquittance to the Commission for the payment out of the Second Injury Fund. No other appropriation or warrant is necessary for payment out of the Second Injury Fund. The Second Injury Fund is appropriated for the purpose of making payments according to the terms of the awards.
    As of July 1, 1980 to July 1, 1982, all claims against and obligations of the Second Injury Fund shall become claims against and obligations of the Rate Adjustment Fund to the extent there is insufficient money in the Second Injury Fund to pay such claims and obligations. In that case, all references to "Second Injury Fund" in this Section shall also include the Rate Adjustment Fund.
    (g) Every award for permanent total disability entered by the Commission on and after July 1, 1965 under which compensation payments shall become due and payable after the effective date of this amendatory Act, and every award for death benefits or permanent total disability entered by the Commission on and after the effective date of this amendatory Act shall be subject to annual adjustments as to the amount of the compensation rate therein provided. Such adjustments shall first be made on July 15, 1977, and all awards made and entered prior to July 1, 1975 and on July 15 of each year thereafter. In all other cases such adjustment shall be made on July 15 of the second year next following the date of the entry of the award and shall further be made on July 15 annually thereafter. If during the intervening period from the date of the entry of the award, or the last periodic adjustment, there shall have been an increase in the State's average weekly wage in covered industries under the Unemployment Insurance Act, the weekly compensation rate shall be proportionately increased by the same percentage as the percentage of increase in the State's average weekly wage in covered industries under the Unemployment Insurance Act. The increase in the compensation rate under this paragraph shall in no event bring the total compensation rate to an amount greater than the prevailing maximum rate at the time that the annual adjustment is made. Such increase shall be paid in the same manner as herein provided for payments under the Second Injury Fund to the injured employee, or his dependents, as the case may be, out of the Rate Adjustment Fund provided in paragraph (f) of Section 7 of this Act. Payments shall be made at the same intervals as provided in the award or, at the option of the Commission, may be made in quarterly payment on the 15th day of January, April, July and October of each year. In the event of a decrease in such average weekly wage there shall be no change in the then existing compensation rate. The within paragraph shall not apply to cases where there is disputed liability and in which a compromise lump sum settlement between the employer and the injured employee, or his dependents, as the case may be, has been duly approved by the Illinois Workers' Compensation Commission.
    Provided, that in cases of awards entered by the Commission for injuries occurring before July 1, 1975, the increases in the compensation rate adjusted under the foregoing provision of this paragraph (g) shall be limited to increases in the State's average weekly wage in covered industries under the Unemployment Insurance Act occurring after July 1, 1975.
    For every accident occurring on or after July 20, 2005 but before the effective date of this amendatory Act of the 94th General Assembly (Senate Bill 1283 of the 94th General Assembly), the annual adjustments to the compensation rate in awards for death benefits or permanent total disability, as provided in this Act, shall be paid by the employer. The adjustment shall be made by the employer on July 15 of the second year next following the date of the entry of the award and shall further be made on July 15 annually thereafter. If during the intervening period from the date of the entry of the award, or the last periodic adjustment, there shall have been an increase in the State's average weekly wage in covered industries under the Unemployment Insurance Act, the employer shall increase the weekly compensation rate proportionately by the same percentage as the percentage of increase in the State's average weekly wage in covered industries under the Unemployment Insurance Act. The increase in the compensation rate under this paragraph shall in no event bring the total compensation rate to an amount greater than the prevailing maximum rate at the time that the annual adjustment is made. In the event of a decrease in such average weekly wage there shall be no change in the then existing compensation rate. Such increase shall be paid by the employer in the same manner and at the same intervals as the payment of compensation in the award. This paragraph shall not apply to cases where there is disputed liability and in which a compromise lump sum settlement between the employer and the injured employee, or his or her dependents, as the case may be, has been duly approved by the Illinois Workers' Compensation Commission.
    The annual adjustments for every award of death benefits or permanent total disability involving accidents occurring before July 20, 2005 and accidents occurring on or after the effective date of this amendatory Act of the 94th General Assembly (Senate Bill 1283 of the 94th General Assembly) shall continue to be paid from the Rate Adjustment Fund pursuant to this paragraph and Section 7(f) of this Act.
    (h) In case death occurs from any cause before the total compensation to which the employee would have been entitled has been paid, then in case the employee leaves any widow, widower, child, parent (or any grandchild, grandparent or other lineal heir or any collateral heir dependent at the time of the accident upon the earnings of the employee to the extent of 50% or more of total dependency) such compensation shall be paid to the beneficiaries of the deceased employee and distributed as provided in paragraph (g) of Section 7.
    (h-1) In case an injured employee is under legal disability at the time when any right or privilege accrues to him or her under this Act, a guardian may be appointed pursuant to law, and may, on behalf of such person under legal disability, claim and exercise any such right or privilege with the same effect as if the employee himself or herself had claimed or exercised the right or privilege. No limitations of time provided by this Act run so long as the employee who is under legal disability is without a conservator or guardian.
    (i) In case the injured employee is under 16 years of age at the time of the accident and is illegally employed, the amount of compensation payable under paragraphs (b), (c), (d), (e) and (f) of this Section is increased 50%.
    However, where an employer has on file an employment certificate issued pursuant to the Child Labor Law or work permit issued pursuant to the Federal Fair Labor Standards Act, as amended, or a birth certificate properly and duly issued, such certificate, permit or birth certificate is conclusive evidence as to the age of the injured minor employee for the purposes of this Section.
    Nothing herein contained repeals or amends the provisions of the Child Labor Law relating to the employment of minors under the age of 16 years.
    (j) 1. In the event the injured employee receives benefits, including medical, surgical or hospital benefits under any group plan covering non-occupational disabilities contributed to wholly or partially by the employer, which benefits should not have been payable if any rights of recovery existed under this Act, then such amounts so paid to the employee from any such group plan as shall be consistent with, and limited to, the provisions of paragraph 2 hereof, shall be credited to or against any compensation payment for temporary total incapacity for work or any medical, surgical or hospital benefits made or to be made under this Act. In such event, the period of time for giving notice of accidental injury and filing application for adjustment of claim does not commence to run until the termination of such payments. This paragraph does not apply to payments made under any group plan which would have been payable irrespective of an accidental injury under this Act. Any employer receiving such credit shall keep such employee safe and harmless from any and all claims or liabilities that may be made against him by reason of having received such payments only to the extent of such credit.
    Any excess benefits paid to or on behalf of a State employee by the State Employees' Retirement System under Article 14 of the Illinois Pension Code on a death claim or disputed disability claim shall be credited against any payments made or to be made by the State of Illinois to or on behalf of such employee under this Act, except for payments for medical expenses which have already been incurred at the time of the award. The State of Illinois shall directly reimburse the State Employees' Retirement System to the extent of such credit.
    2. Nothing contained in this Act shall be construed to give the employer or the insurance carrier the right to credit for any benefits or payments received by the employee other than compensation payments provided by this Act, and where the employee receives payments other than compensation payments, whether as full or partial salary, group insurance benefits, bonuses, annuities or any other payments, the employer or insurance carrier shall receive credit for each such payment only to the extent of the compensation that would have been payable during the period covered by such payment.
    3. The extension of time for the filing of an Application for Adjustment of Claim as provided in paragraph 1 above shall not apply to those cases where the time for such filing had expired prior to the date on which payments or benefits enumerated herein have been initiated or resumed. Provided however that this paragraph 3 shall apply only to cases wherein the payments or benefits hereinabove enumerated shall be received after July 1, 1969.

===================================================================



 


Â§8.1a: Preferred Provider Program
Section 8.1a. Preferred provider programs. Starting on the effective date of this
amendatory Act of the 97th General Assembly, to satisfy its liabilities under this
Act for the provision of medical treatment to injured employees, an employer
63
may utilize a preferred provider program approved by the Illinois Department of
Insurance as in compliance with Sections 370k, 370l, 370m, and 370p of Article
XX-1/2 of the Illinois Insurance Code. For the purposes of compliance with these
Sections, the employee shall be considered the ~beneficiary~ and the employer
shall be considered the ~insured~. Employers and insurers contracting directly
with providers or utilizing multiple preferred provider programs to implement a
preferred provider program providing workers' compensation benefits shall be
subject to the above requirements of Article XX-1/2 applicable to administrators
with regard to such program, with the exception of Section 370l of the Illinois
Insurance Code.
(a) In addition to the above requirements of Article XX-1/2 of the Illinois
Insurance Code, all preferred provider programs under this Section shall
meet the following requirements:
(1) The provider network shall include an adequate number of occupational
and non-occupational providers.
(2) The provider network shall include an adequate number and type of
physicians or other providers to treat common injuries experienced by
injured workers in the geographic area where the employees reside.
(3) Medical treatment for injuries shall be readily available at reasonable
times to all employees. To the extent feasible, all medical treatment for
injuries shall be readily accessible to all employees.
(4) Physician compensation shall not be structured in order to achieve the
goal of inappropriately reducing, delaying, or denying medical treatment
or restricting access to medical treatment.
(5) Before entering into any agreement under this Section, a program shall
establish terms and conditions that must be met by noninstitutional
providers wishing to enter into an agreement with the program. These
terms and conditions may not discriminate unreasonably against or
among noninstitutional providers. Neither difference in prices among
noninstitutional providers produced by a process of individual
negotiation nor price differences among other noninstitutional providers
in different geographical areas or different specialties constitutes
unreasonable discrimination.
(b) The administrator of any preferred provider program under this Act that uses
economic evaluation shall file with the Director of Insurance a description of
any policies and procedures related to economic evaluation utilized by the
program. The filing shall describe how these policies and procedures are
used in utilization review, peer review, incentive and penalty programs, and
in provider retention and termination decisions. The Director of Insurance
may deny approval of any preferred provider program that uses any policy or
procedure of economic evaluation to inappropriately reduce, delay or deny
medical treatment, or to restrict access to medical treatment. Evaluation of
providers based upon objective medical quality and patient outcome
measurements, appropriate use of best clinical practices and evidence based
64
medicine, and use of health information technology shall be permitted. If
approved, the employer shall provide a copy of the filing to all participating
providers.
(1) The Director of the Department of Insurance shall make each
administrator's filing available to the public upon request. The Director
of the Department of Insurance may not publicly disclose any
information submitted pursuant to this Section that is determined by the
Director of the Department of Insurance to be confidential, proprietary,
or trade secret information pursuant to State or federal law.
(2) For the purposes of this subsection (b), ~economic evaluation~ shall
mean any evaluation of a particular physician, provider, medical group,
or individual practice association based in whole or in part on the
economic costs or utilization of services associated with medical care
provided or authorized by the physician, provider, medical group, or
individual practice association. Economic evaluation shall not include
negotiated rates with a provider.
(c) Except for the provisions of subsection (a)(4) of Section 8 and for injuries
occurring on or after the effective date of this amendatory Act of the 97th
General Assembly, an employee of an employer utilizing a preferred
provider program shall only be allowed to select a participating network
provider from the network. An employer shall be responsible for:
(i) all first aid and emergency treatment;
(ii) all medical, surgical, and hospital services provided by the participating
network provider initially selected by the employee or by any other
participating network provider recommended by the initial participating
network provider or any subsequent participating network provider in
the chain of referrals from the initial participating network provider; and
(iii) all medical, surgical, and hospital services provided by the participating
network provider subsequently chosen by the employee or by any other
participating network provider recommended by the subsequent
participating network provider or any subsequent participating network
provider in the chain of referrals from the second participating network
provider. An employer shall not be liable for services determined by the
Commission not to be compensable. An employer shall not be liable for
medical services provided by a non-authorize provider when proper
notice is provided to the injured worker.
(1) When the injured employee notifies the employer of the injury or files a
claim for workers' compensation with the employer, the employer shall
notify the employee of his or her right to be treated by a physician of his
or her choice from the preferred provider network established pursuant
to this Section, and the method by which the list of participating network
providers may be accessed by the employee, except as provided in
subsection (a)(4) of Section 8.

(820 ILCS 305/10) (from Ch. 48, par. 138.10)Sec. 10. The basis for computing the compensation provided for in Sections 7 and 8 of the Act shall be as follows:The compensation shall be computed on the basis of the "Average weekly wage" which shall mean the actual earnings of the employee in the employment in which he was working at the time of the injury during the period of 52 weeks ending with the last day of the employee's last full pay period immediately preceding the date of injury, illness or disablement excluding overtime, and bonus divided by 52; but if the injured employee lost 5 or more calendar days during such period, whether or not in the same week, then the earnings for the remainder of such 52 weeks shall be divided by the number of weeks and parts thereof remaining after the time so lost has been deducted. Where the employment prior to the injury extended over a period of less than 52 weeks, the method of dividing the earnings during that period by the number of weeks and parts thereof during which the employee actually earned wages shall be followed. Where by reason of the shortness of the time during which the employee has been in the employment of his employer or of the casual nature or terms of the employment, it is impractical to compute the average weekly wages as above defined, regard shall be had to the average weekly amount which during the 52 weeks previous to the injury, illness or disablement was being or would have been earned by a person in the same grade employed at the same work for each of such 52 weeks for the same number of hours per week by the same employer. In the case of volunteer firemen, police and civil defense members or trainees, the income benefits shall be based on the average weekly wage in their regular employment. When the employee is working concurrently with two or more employers and the respondent employer has knowledge of such employment prior to the injury, his wages from all such employers shall be considered as if earned from the employer liable for compensation.(Source: P.A. 81â1482.)

In a case where theemployer refuses to pay compensation according to such final award orsuch final decision upon which such judgment is entered the courtshall in entering judgment thereon, tax as costs against him thereasonable costs and attorney fees in the arbitration proceedings andin the court entering the judgment for the person in whose favor thejudgment is entered, which judgment and costs taxed as thereinprovided shall, until and unless set aside, have the same effect asthough duly entered in an action duly tried and determined by thecourt, and shall with like effect, be entered and docketed. TheCircuit Court shall have power at any time upon application to makeany such judgment conform to any modification required by anysubsequent decision of the Supreme Court upon appeal, or as theresult of any subsequent proceedings for review, as provided in thisAct.

However, as to accidents occurring subsequent to July 1, 1955,which are covered by any agreement or award under this Act providingfor compensation in installments made as a result of such accident,such agreement or award may at any time within 30 months, or 60months in the case of an award under Section 8(d)1, after suchagreement or award be reviewed by the Commission at the request ofeither the employer or the employee on the ground that the disabilityof the employee has subsequently recurred, increased, diminished orended. On such review, compensation payments may be re-established,increased, diminished or ended. The Commission shall give 15 days'notice to the parties of the hearing for review. Any employee, uponany petition for such review being filed by the employer, shall beentitled to one day's notice for each 100 miles necessary to betraveled by him in attending the hearing of the Commission upon thepetition, and 3 days in addition thereto. Such employee shall, at thediscretion of the Commission, also be entitled to 5 cents per milenecessarily traveled by him within the State of Illinois in attendingsuch hearing, not to exceed a distance of 300 miles, to be taxed bythe Commission as costs and deposited with the petition of theemployer.

(i) Each party, upon taking any proceedings or steps whatsoeverbefore any Arbitrator, Commission or court, shall file with theCommission his address, or the name and address of any agent uponwhom all notices to be given to such party shall be served, eitherpersonally or by registered mail, addressed to such party or agent atthe last address so filed with the Commission. In the event suchparty has not filed his address, or the name and address of an agentas above provided, service of any notice may be had by filing suchnotice with the Commission. (j) Whenever in any proceeding testimony has been taken or afinal decision has been rendered and after the taking of suchtestimony or after such decision has become final, the injuredemployee dies, then in any subsequent proceedings brought by thepersonal representative or beneficiaries of the deceased employee,such testimony in the former proceeding may be introduced with thesame force and effect as though the witness having so testified werepresent in person in such subsequent proceedings and such finaldecision, if any, shall be taken as final adjudication of any of theissues which are the same in both proceedings. (k) In case where there has been any unreasonable or vexatiousdelay of payment or intentional underpayment of compensation, orproceedings have been instituted or carried on by the one liable topay the compensation, which do not present a real controversy, butare merely frivolous or for delay, then the Commission may awardcompensation additional to that otherwise payable under this Actequal to 50% of the amount payable at the time of such award. Failureto pay compensation in accordance with the provisions of Section 8,paragraph (b) of this Act, shall be considered unreasonable delay. When determining whether this subsection (k) shall apply, theCommission shall consider whether an Arbitrator has determined thatthe claim is not compensable or whether the employer has madepayments under Section 8(j). (l) If the employee has made written demand for payment ofbenefits under Section 8(a) or Section 8(b), the employer shall have14 days after receipt of the demand to set forth in writing thereason for the delay.

A delay inpayment of 14 days or more shall create a rebuttable presumption ofunreasonable delay. (m) If the commission finds that an accidental injury wasdirectly and proximately caused by the employer's wilful violation ofa health and safety standard under the Health and Safety Act in forceat the time of the accident, the arbitrator or the Commission shallallow to the injured employee or his dependents, as the case may be,additional compensation equal to 25% of the amount which otherwisewould be payable under the provisions of this Act exclusive of thisparagraph. The additional compensation herein provided shall beallowed by an appropriate increase in the applicable weeklycompensation rate.

Said rate of interest shall be set forth in theArbitrator's Decision. Interest shall be drawn from the date of thearbitrator's award on all accrued compensation due the employeethrough the day prior to the date of payments. However, when anemployee appeals an award of an Arbitrator or the Commission, and theappeal results in no change or a decrease in the award, interestshall not further accrue from the date of such appeal. The employer or his insurance carrier may tender the paymentsdue under the award to stop the further accrual of interest on suchaward notwithstanding the prosecution by either party of review,certiorari, appeal to the Supreme Court or other steps to reverse,vacate or modify the award. (o) By the 15th day of each month each insurer providingcoverage for losses under this Act shall notify each insured employerof any compensable claim incurred during the preceding month and theamounts paid or reserved on the claim including a summary of theclaim and a brief statement of the reasons for compensability. Acumulative report of all claims incurred during a calendar year orcontinued from the previous year shall be furnished to the insuredemployer by the insurer within 30 days after the end of that calendaryear. The insured employer may challenge, in proceeding before theCommission, payments made by the insurer without arbitration andpayments made after a case is determined to be noncompensable. If theCommission finds that the case was not compensable, the insurer shallpurge its records as to that employer of any loss or expenseassociated with the claim, reimburse the employer for attorneys' feesarising from the challenge and for any payment required of theemployer to the Rate Adjustment Fund or the Second Injury Fund, andmay not reflect the loss or expense for rate making purposes. Theemployee shall not be required to refund the challenged payment. Thedecision of the Commission may be reviewed in the same manner as inarbitrated cases. No challenge may be initiated under this paragraphmore than 3 years after the payment is made. An employer may waivethe right of challenge under this paragraph on a case by case basis. (p) After filing an application for adjustment of claim butprior to the hearing on arbitration the parties may voluntarily agreeto submit such application for adjustment of claim for decision by anarbitrator under this subsection (p) where such application foradjustment of claim raises only a dispute over temporary totaldisability, permanent partial disability or medical expenses. Suchagreement shall be in writing in such form as provided by theCommission. Applications for adjustment of claim submitted fordecision by an arbitrator under this subsection (p) shall proceedaccording to rule as established by the Commission. The Commissionshall promulgate rules including, but not limited to, rules to ensurethat the parties are adequately informed of their rights under thissubsection (p) and of the voluntary nature of proceedings under thissubsection (p). The findings of fact made by an arbitrator actingwithin his or her powers under this subsection (p) in the absence offraud shall be conclusive. However, the arbitrator may on his ownmotion, or the motion of either party, correct any clerical errors orerrors in computation within 15 days after the date of receipt ofsuch award of the arbitrator and shall have the power to recall theoriginal award on arbitration, and issue in lieu thereof suchcorrected award. The decision of the arbitrator under this subsection(p) shall be considered the decision of the Commission andproceedings for review of questions of law arising from the decisionmay be commenced by either party pursuant to subsection (f) ofSection 19. The Advisory Board established under Section 13.1 shallcompile a list of certified Commission arbitrators, each of whomshall be approved by at least 7 members of the Advisory Board. Thechairman shall select 5 persons from such list to serve asarbitrators under this subsection (p). By agreement, the partiesshall select one arbitrator from among the 5 persons selected by thechairman except that if the parties do not agree on an arbitratorfrom among the 5 persons, the parties may, by agreement, select anarbitrator of the American Arbitration Association, whose fee shallbe paid by the State in accordance with rules promulgated by theCommission.

===================================================================



 

AUTHORITY: Implementing the Electronic Commerce Security Act [5 ILCS 175] and authorized by Section 13 of the Illinois Workers' Compensation Act [820 ILCS 305/13].
SOURCE: Adopted at 40 Ill. Reg. 15700, effective November 9, 2016.

Section 9015.10 Overview of Electronic Filing
a) The Electronic Commerce Security Act [5 ILCS 175] (ECSA) authorizes State agencies to send and receive electronic records and electronic signatures to and from other persons and otherwise create, use, store and rely upon electronic records and electronic signatures. The purpose of the ECSA is to facilitate electronic communication by means of reliable electronic records, and to facilitate electronic filing of documents with State agencies. By virtue of the ECSA, and with guidance from Supreme Court Rules, the Illinois Workers' Compensation Commission adopts this Part.
b) Pursuant to Section 13 of the Illinois Workers' Compensation Act (Act), the Chairman will set forth administrative guidelines for the implementation of a system by which documents filed under this Part may be formatted and filed electronically. The Chairman shall set forth administrative procedures by which pro se nonattorney litigants may gain access to and file documents using the electronic filing system.
c) Prior to filing any document electronically with the Commission, users are required to register with the Commission and provide all information as required by the Commission's registration procedure. Users shall promptly update the required information. The Commission shall provide an identifier to all registered participants and a means to confirm that the filing was approved by an authorized user. The Attorney Registration and Disciplinary Commission number may be used as the identifier for attorneys to ensure that the attorney is licensed and in good standing.
d) The e-filing system will allow the Commission to verify whether an attorney who registers as a user is authorized to practice in Illinois.
e) Information, records and signatures shall not be denied legal effect, validity or enforceability solely on the grounds that they are in electronic form. Further, if statute, regulation or case law requires information to be "written" or "in writing", or provides for certain consequences if it is not, an electronic record satisfies that requirement.





===================================================================
--->illinois--->Illinois Rules--->PART 9015 ELECTRONIC FILING--->Section 9015.20 Format
===================================================================



 

Section 9015.20 Format
a) Documents must be submitted in the format prescribed by the Commission or in PDF format directly from the program creating the document, rather than the scanned image of a paper document. All electronically filed documents shall include the case caption and nature of filing. Each document shall include the typed name, e-mail address and telephone number of the attorney filing the document.
b) All electronically filed documents shall, to the extent possible, be formatted in accordance with this Part.
c) Electronic documents containing links to material either within the filed document or external to the document are for convenience purposes only. The external material behind the link is not considered part of the filing or basic record.
d) Bulk filing of multiple cases or multiple documents combined into one PDF document will not be accepted. Documents with different workers' compensation numbers must be filed individually.
e) Documents not complying with ECSA or this Part may be rejected.

Upon submission of the e-filed document, the e-filing provider will e-mail the registered user a transaction confirmation that includes the transaction number, a list of the documents submitted, and the date and time of submittal. The transaction number shall serve as proof of submittal.
b) Filings may include pleadings, petitions, motions, proofs of service, exhibits or any other Commission authorized document. Communication between attorneys or attorneys and their clients shall not be filed electronically, unless part of a pleading, petition, motion or a Commission authorized document.
c) A person who files a document electronically shall have the same responsibility as a person filing a document in the conventional manner for ensuring that the document is complete, readable and properly filed.
d) A document shall be considered timely filed if e-filed at any time before midnight on or before the date on which the document is due. If the date required for filing falls on a Saturday, Sunday or holiday, the time for filing shall be the next date that is not a Saturday, Sunday or holiday. A document submitted at or after midnight or on a day that is not a Commission business day (see 50 Ill. Adm. Code 9020.10(c)) shall be considered filed the next Commission business day.
e) The transmission date and time of transfer shall govern the electronic file mark. Each document reviewed and accepted for filing by the Commission will receive an electronic file stamp.
f) If an e-filed document is untimely filed due to a technical failure or a system outage, the registered user may seek appropriate relief from the Commission.
g) Proposed Decisions are to be submitted via e-mail directly to the Arbitrator in Microsoft Word format. For Proposed Decisions, only the proof of service must be e-filed.
h) In any proceeding before the Commission, nothing in the application of the rules of evidence shall be applied in a manner that denies the admissibility of an electronic record or electronic signature. Information in the electronic record will be given due evidentiary weight by the Commission.
50 ILLINOIS ADMINISTRATIVE CODE 9015 9015.30
i) Any electronic document or record submitted to the Commission will be deemed filed if not rejected by the Commission. The transmission date and time shall govern the electronic file mark.
j) An e-filed document must not contain viruses or malware. The e-filing of a document constitutes a certification by the registered user that the document has been checked for viruses and malware.
k) All filed documents that are required to be maintained and preserved must be kept for one year after the appellate process period has been completed.

c) The original signed document that has been electronically filed shall be maintained and preserved by the party filing the document and presented to the Commission upon its request.
d) Documents containing signatures of third parties may be filed electronically and shall bear a facsimile or typographical signature. If a document requires the signature of one or more persons not a party to the case or not registered for electronic filing, the subscriber must confirm all persons required to sign the document approve it. Original signatures of all nonregistered persons must be obtained before filing the document. The document must indicate the identity of each nonregistered signatory. The subscriber must retain the original document for one year after the date that the judgment has become final or the expiration of the time for seeking review. The subscriber must make the document available for inspection by the Commission upon request.
e) Documents filed electronically by a Commissioner or an Arbitrator under his or her identifier shall be deemed entered by that Commissioner or Arbitrator.

a) Electronic service is not capable of conferring jurisdiction. Documents requiring personal service to confer jurisdiction may not be served electronically.
b) All other documents may be served upon the other party or the party's representative electronically. The subscriber shall be responsible for completing electronic service of the documents. By registering in the electronic filing system, the subscribers consent to receipt of all other documents e-filed and e-served upon them.
c) Subscribers consent to receive all communication from the Commission, including but not limited to notice of hearing, orders, decisions, or any general correspondence via electronic filing. The Commission may also issue any Commission document via e-mail.

===================================================================



 

Section 9020.80 Petitions for Immediate Hearing
a) Petition for Immediate Hearing Under Section 19(b)
1) In a Petition alleging that the Petitioner is not receiving benefits under Section 8(a) and/or 8(b) of the Act to which he or she is entitled, the Petitioner may file a Petition for Immediate Hearing, as provided for in Section 19(b) of the Act, on an appropriate form provided by the Commission. The Petition shall set forth:
A) a description of the attempts by parties or counsel to resolve the dispute requiring an immediate hearing, including the name of the representative of the opposing party with whom the Petitioner or his or her attorney has conferred, the date of the conference, and the result of the conference;
B) a statement that a signed physician's report of recent date relating to the employee's current inability to work, or a description of such other evidence of temporary total disability as is appropriate under the circumstances, has been delivered to the Respondent.
2) A response to the Petition shall be filed on an appropriate form provided by the Commission within 15 days after service of a Petition for Immediate Hearing. Failure to respond timely or in good faith may result in the assessment of the attorneys' fees under Section 16 of the Act. The Petition for Immediate Hearing shall be filed and heard in accordance with Section 9020.70.
3) The Arbitrator to whom the case is assigned shall attempt to resolve the matter informally. If the matter cannot be resolved at that time, and the Arbitrator determines the Petitioner is not receiving benefits as provided in subsection (a)(1), the Arbitrator shall order the case to formal hearing.
b) Petition for Immediate Hearing under Section 19(b-1).
1) Filing Petition for Emergency Hearing under Section 19(b-1)
An employee alleging that he or she is unable to work because of disability compensable under the Act or the Workers' Occupational Diseases Act [820 ILCS 310], and not receiving temporary total disability and/or medical, surgical or hospital benefits to which he or she is entitled under Section 8(a) or 8(b) of the Act, may file a Petition for Immediate Hearing before an Arbitrator as provided for in Section 19(b-1) of the Act.
The Petition shall be filed on an appropriate form provided by the Commission and must comply with all requirements of the Act.
2) Section 19(b-1) Proceedings before Arbitrators: Pre-trial Conferences
A) The Arbitrator will hold a pre-trial conference within 20 days after the Petition for Emergency Hearing is filed. If the venue is outside of Cook County, the pre-trial conference will be held at either the regularly scheduled hearing site or at another hearing site for the same Arbitrator available within that time period and located as close as practical to the original hearing site. Notice of pre-trial conference will be sent by the Commission to all parties of record.
B) Any challenges to the sufficiency of the Section 19(b-1) Petition will be heard at the pre-trial conference.
C) If the Section 19(b-1) Petition is found by the Arbitrator to be insufficient, the Arbitrator will allow the Petitioner 5 business days to cure all insufficiencies, and all time limits under the statute are tolled until the Arbitrator has determined that the amended Petition is sufficient. During this time period, the amended Section 19(b-1) Petition, with proof of service to opposing party, shall be filed with the Commission. If the insufficiencies are not cured within the time limit, the Section 19(b-1) Petition will be dismissed without prejudice by the Arbitrator and notices of the dismissal will be sent by the Commission to all parties of record.
D) If, within the time period provided in subsection (b)(2)(C), the insufficiencies are cured and the parties have not received from the Commission notices of dismissal of the Section 19(b-1) Petition, the Respondent shall have 15 days from receipt of the amended Section 19(b-1) Petition to respond.
3) Section 19(b-1) Hearing, Decisions, and Transcripts
A) Hearings
i) If, at the pre-trial conference, the Arbitrator finds the Section 19(b-1) Petition to be sufficient, he or she will set the case to be tried within 15 days at either the regularly scheduled hearing site or at another hearing site for the same Arbitrator available within that time period and located as closely as practical to original hearing site.
ii) If the Section 19(b-1) Petition is insufficient, the Arbitrator will set the case to be tried within 35 days after the pre-trial conference at either the regularly scheduled hearing site for the same Arbitrator or at another hearing site for the same Arbitrator available within the time period and located as closely as practical to the original hearing site. If, within the time period provided in subsection (b)(2), the insufficiencies are cured and the parties have not received from the Commission notices of dismissal of the Section 19(b-1) Petition, the trial will be held as scheduled.
iii) Proofs are to be closed within 45 days after a Section 19(b-1) Petition, or an amended Petition curing any insufficiencies as provided in subsection (b)(3)(A)(ii) is filed, unless for good cause the Arbitrator extends the time for closing proofs for an additional period or periods not to exceed a total extension period of 30 days. Good cause is defined as, but not limited to, additional medical records needed and taking of depositional evidence.
B) Arbitrator Decision
The Arbitrator's decision is to be filed with the Commission within 25 days after proofs are closed. The Arbitrator's decision shall contain the final cost of the arbitration transcript, or the estimated cost of the transcript if the final cost is not available at the time the Arbitrator's decision is issued.
C) Transcripts
i) At the beginning of each hearing at which a record is made, the Arbitrator shall state the following for the record:
Upon the closing of proofs, at the request of any party, the Arbitrator shall order the Court Reporter to prepare an original transcript of this hearing, to be authenticated by the Arbitrator for use by the Commission in the event it is required for further proceedings, including any proceedings for a review of the Arbitrator's decision. The parties may order copies of the transcript of today's hearing at the close of the hearing, to be charged at the rate provided in Section 16 of the Workers' Compensation Act for copies of transcript. Each party shall pay the cost of its copy. If a Petition for Review is filed, the appealing party shall pay the cost of the original transcript. If no Petition for Review is filed, the parties shall pay the cost of the original transcript, to be divided equally among the parties. At the close of each day's hearing on Arbitration, the Court Reporter shall provide an estimate of the cost of preparing the transcript. The estimated cost of the transcript may not be the final cost of the transcript for which a party is liable. If the party orders the transcript at a later time, it is unlikely it will be received in sufficient time for use in preparation of the party's Statement of Exceptions and Supporting Brief, or a response to that statement, in the event either party files a Petition for Review of the Arbitrator's decision. If the original is not on file, in the event a transcript is ordered, it will be prepared as an original and the party will be charged at a rate provided for in Section 16 of the Workers' Compensation Act. The Commission will not consider the unavailability of the transcript good cause for the failure to file a timely Statement of Exceptions and Supporting Brief, or a response to that statement.
ii) When the transcript of proceedings has been ordered pursuant to subsection (b)(3)(C)(i), the transcript shall be authenticated by the Arbitrator and a copy of the statement of the final cost of the preparation of the transcript shall be filed by the Court Reporter at the Commission within 25 days after proofs are closed. When the transcript of the proceedings is ordered at the time a Petition for Review is filed and the transcript has been received, the transcript shall be authenticated and filed pursuant to subsection (b)(4)(A)(iii).
4) Section 19(b-1) Proceedings before the Commission
A) Perfecting a Review
A Petition for Review must be filed in duplicate at the Commission within the time provided by Section 19 of the Workers' Compensation Act. The Petition must contain or be accompanied by the following:
i) A Certificate of Service on the opposing party by personal service or certified mail;
ii) A certification that payment for the transcript in the amount set forth in the Arbitrator's Decision has been made to the Court Reporter. The Petition shall be accompanied by a copy of the check or money order sent to the Court Reporter. When the amount paid is an estimate, the balance of the cost, if any, shall be paid upon receipt of the statement from the Court Reporter setting forth the final cost of the transcript. An order entered pursuant to Section 20 of the Workers' Compensation Act may be submitted for payment of the transcript;
iii) An order for the transcript of proceedings at Arbitration, when the transcript was not ordered at Arbitration. The transcript of proceedings authenticated by the Arbitrator shall be filed by the Court Reporter at the Commission within 25 days after the filing of the Petition for Review.
iv) A statement of Appellant's specific exceptions to the Arbitrator's Decision; attachment of the Statement of Exceptions and Supporting Brief required by subsection (b)(4)(B) will satisfy this requirement.
B) Statement of Exceptions and Supporting Brief
i) Any party filing a Petition for Review with the Commission shall file a Statement of Exceptions and Supporting Brief with attached proof of service within 15 days after the filing of the Petition for Review. If the Appellee elects to file a response to the Petition, the response must be filed and served on the opposing party within 15 days after the last day allowed for the filing of the Appellant's Statement of Exceptions and Supporting Brief. Each party filing a Statement of Exceptions and Supporting Brief, or a response, shall file 3 copies. The Statement of Exceptions and Supporting Brief, or response, shall be written or printed on one side of no more than 20 8Â½ x 11" sheets of paper or contain no more than 5,200 words, whichever is greater, and shall follow the format set forth in 50 Ill. Adm. Code 9040.70(a). Failure of any appellant or petitioning party to file timely a Statement of Exception(s) and Supporting Brief may result in denial of oral argument.
ii) Timely filing shall be shown by: the date file stamped on the document at the time of receipt by the Commission at its office in Chicago, Illinois; a legible postmark date at least 2 calendar days prior to and exclusive of the date on which the document was due to be filed in accordance with this Section, applied by the U.S. Postal Service, and not by a party, to the envelope in which the document is received by the Commission at its office in Chicago, Illinois, or the date applied by the U.S. Postal Service to a certified or registered mail receipt bearing the same certification or registry number as the envelope in which the document was received by the Commission at its offices in Chicago, Illinois, showing a date of mailing that is not less than 2 calendar days prior to and exclusive of the date on which document was due to be filed. If the date required for filing or mailing falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or holiday, the time for filing or mailing shall be the next date that is not a Saturday, Sunday or holiday. Electronically filed documents shall be filed in accordance with 50 Ill. Adm. Code 9015.30.
C) Hearing on Review and Oral Arguments
No Hearing on Review will be held by the Commission. Immediately after the Petition for Review has been filed, it will be assigned to a Commissioner who will promptly schedule the case for oral argument before a panel of 3 Commissioners, as provided in Section 19(e) of the Act.
D) The Commission shall file its decision no more than 90 days after the filing of the Petition for Review, and not later than 180 days after the filing of the Petition under Section 19(b-1) of the Act, whichever is sooner.
5) Service in Section 19(b-1) Proceedings
All service required pursuant to this Section must be by personal service or certified mail with return receipt. After initial service to the employer, service shall be made on the employer's attorney or designated representative.

Section 9030.20 Setting a Case for Trial
a) A written request for a date certain for trial may be made by any party at the monthly status call on which the case appears. A request for a trial date in a case that does not appear on the monthly status call may only be made in accordance with 50 Ill. Adm. Code 9020.60(b)(2)(B).
b) If the parties, by agreement, request a trial date, the Arbitrator shall assign a specific date and time for trial. A pre-trial conference may be held by the Arbitrator. Either party may request a pre-trial conference prior to the start of trial.
c) The motions for trial dates shall be filed and heard pursuant to 50 Ill. Adm. Code 9020.70 and 9020.60.
1) The Arbitrator shall set the matter for trial on a date certain if:

B) the opposing party was provided with a completed Request for Hearing;
C) the case appears on the monthly status call on the date the motion is heard, or if the case is not on the status call, the Arbitrator has determined that the case falls within the exceptions in 50 Ill. Adm. Code 9020.60(b)(2)(B); and
D) the Arbitrator determines that the matter should proceed to trial.
2) If any party fails, without good cause, to appear, the Arbitrator will hear the motion for trial date ex parte and, if the Arbitrator determines the matter is ready for trial, will set a trial date convenient to the Arbitrator and the party that appeared. The party that appeared shall notify the opposing party of the trial date.
d) On each trial day, each party or, if represented, the party's attorney of record must appear before the Arbitrator between 8:45 a.m. and 9:30 a.m. During this time period, the Arbitrator may establish the order in which cases shall proceed that day.

B) An employer who earns a total of 18 points in the 3 financial ratios in subsection (c)(2)(A) in each year of the most current 3 years' audited financial statements and has been self-insured for a minimum of 3 consecutive years may be deemed to have satisfied the Commission of its financial strength to meet its workers' compensation obligations without the necessity of furnishing security, indemnity or bond or making some other provision satisfactory to the Commission for securing its workers' compensation obligations pursuant to subsection (c)(3).
C) A total of 9 to 18 points earned in the 3 financial ratios in subsection (c)(2)(A) shall create a rebuttable presumption that the employer's application should be approved conditional upon the furnishing of appropriate security or other means satisfactory to the Commission for securing its workers' compensation obligations pursuant to subsection (c)(3).
D) The Board may recommend for approval applicants who earn less than 9 points in the financial ratios of subsection (c)(2)(A) if the employer's application and financial statement, together with appropriate security or other means satisfactory to the Commission for securing its workers' compensation obligations pursuant to subsection (c)(3), demonstrate the ability of the employer to meet its obligations under the Act/WODA.
3) Security
When an applicant is required to furnish security or provide some other means satisfactory to the Commission to guarantee payment of its workers' compensation obligation, the furnishing of that security or other provision shall be a condition precedent to the approval of the initial or renewal application for self-insurance. The Chairman shall also require that the applicant further secure payment of liabilities under the
50 ILLINOIS ADMINISTRATIVE CODE 9100 9100.40
Act/WODA by obtaining a policy of excess workers' compensation insurance on such form as may be required by the Commission.
A) Security Determination
i) The amount of the security shall be based upon, but not be limited to, such criteria as the employer's financial strength, industry, the amount of excess insurance, and demonstrated loss experience.
ii) An employer's financial strength shall be determined by applying the financial ratio summarization in this subsection (c)(3)(A). The financial ratio summarization is based upon the total number of earned points as calculated by applying the financial ratios in subsection (c)(2)(A). A financial factor (percentage) is assigned to the financial ratio summarization. The applicable financial factor is applied in determining the amount of security in subsections (c)(3)(B) and (C).
Financial Ratio Summarization

16 - 18 points

35%
14 - 15 points
=
40%
12 - 13 points
=
60%
9 - 11 points
=
70%
B) Security/Loss Fund Determination
i) When the employer submits audited financial statements containing an unqualified opinion, the security requirement shall be determined by using the highest amount of security obtained after applying the following formulas:
Minimum security to be not less than $200,000.
RESERVE FORMULA
Total outstanding loss reserves are multiplied by the applicable trending factor. In the event that an employer's losses are affected by growth or size of the entity, the reserves may be equalized. The following formula is then
applied:
total outstanding loss reserves (loss fund) x applicable trending factor x applicable financial factor = security.
PAID LOSS FORMULA
Paid losses for up to each of the last 5 years are multiplied by the applicable trending factors. The total of paid losses is divided by the number of years used to obtain the average yearly paid loss. However, in the event that an employer's losses are affected by growth or size of the entity, the paid losses may be equalized. The following formula is then applied:
average yearly paid loss (loss fund) x applicable trending factor x applicable financial factor = security.
ii) If the employer submits financial statements that do not contain an unqualified opinion or are not audited, the security requirements shall be determined by using the highest amount of security obtained after applying the following formulas:
Minimum security to be not less than $200,000.
RESERVE FORMULA
total outstanding loss reserves (loss fund) x applicable trending factor x 125% = security.
PAID LOSS FORMULA
Paid losses for up to each of the last 5 years are multiplied by the applicable trending factors. The total of paid losses is divided by the number of years used to obtain the average yearly paid loss. The following formula is then applied:
average yearly paid loss (loss fund) x applicable trending factor x 125% = security
50 ILLINOIS ADMINISTRATIVE CODE 9100 9100.40
iii) If the employer self-administers its workers' compensation claims program, or if the claims administration contract with an outside administrator does not include service on a life of claim basis, a factor of 120% is applied to the formulas used in subsection (c)(3)(B)(i) and (ii) to cover the contingent claims cost in the event of insolvency.
iv) All trending factors used in this subsection (b)(3)(C) are adopted by resolution of the Board and are available from the Board or the Commission upon request. Trending factors are determined by reviewing the rates of inflation for self-insurance, including claim payments, both medical and indemnity, and costs of claim administration. The trending factor shall be determined after consultation with a Fellow of the Casualty Actuarial Society.
C) The security requirement for self-insurers who, upon initial or renewal application, earn less than 9 points after applying the financial ratios in subsection (c)(2)(A), shall be determined as a percentage of the loss fund size as follows:
Points Scored
Loss Fund Size
Percentage

If the percentage of loss fund referred to in this subsection (b)(3)(C) is less than 125% and the employer has submitted financial statements that do not contain an unqualified opinion or
are not audited, the percentage of loss fund used will be 125%. In addition, if the employer self-administers its workers' compensation claims program or if the claims administration contract with an outside administrator does not include service on a life of claim basis, a factor of 120% is applied to cover the contingent claims cost in the event of insolvency.
D) Acceptable Security Instruments
i) Surety Bond: Must be on a form prescribed by the Commission. No surety bond may be terminated unless the Chairman has received written notice of the prospective termination at least 60 days prior to the termination date.

The cash or bonds shall be deposited in escrow with any State or national bank or trust company having trust authority in the State of Illinois. (Section 4(b) of the Act) All escrow agreements shall be on a form provided by the Commission. Securities used to fund an escrow account shall have at all times a market value at least equal to the security requirement determined by the Chairman. (See subsection (c)(3)(A).)

4) Guarantee Agreement
A subsidiary or a controlled employer shall obtain a guarantee agreement executed by the parent company or controlling persons designated by the Commission. Pursuant to the agreement, the parent company or the controlling persons shall guarantee that the obligations of the subsidiary or the controlled employer under the Act/WODA shall be paid. The guarantee agreement shall be submitted on a form prescribed by the Commission. Whenever a guarantor under such an agreement ceases to be a parent company or controlling persons with respect to the subsidiary or controlled employer whose obligations it has guaranteed, the former parent company and subsidiary or controlling persons and controlled
employer shall notify the Commission immediately. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Part, if the Board determines that a controlled person or subsidiary is controlled by an alien controlling person or parent company, is a utility, or is unable or unwilling to provide a guarantee agreement, the Chairman may, in his or her discretion, waive the requirement that the controlled employer or subsidiary provide a guarantee agreement; if the controlled employer or subsidiary or utility furnishes to the Commission security in an amount to be determined by the same methods used when an unaudited financial statement has been provided in accordance with subsection (c)(3)(B)(ii). "Alien controlling person" or "parent company" means a controlling person or parent company created or organized under the laws of a jurisdiction other than the United States of America or any political subdivision thereof.

The notice shall set forth a time and place of hearing on the matter, which shall be within 30 days after the date of the notice. The Chairman shall notify the employer of the decision in writing after the hearing date. These decisions shall be subject to review under subsection (h).

2) Former self-insurers shall be liable for any and all assessments until they have discharged all obligations to pay compensation that arose during the self-insurance period. (Section 4a-7(b) of the Act)

4) After all claims within the class have been paid in full, if any amount from the proceeds of securities, indemnity or bonds remains for distribution, payments of all other claims will be prorated on the basis of the amount of each identified claim in proportion to the amount of the remainder of the securities, indemnity or bonds.

a) An employer's vocational rehabilitation counselor, in consultation with the injured employee and, if represented, with his or her representative, shall prepare a written assessment of the course of medical care and, if appropriate, vocational rehabilitation required to return the injured worker to employment. The vocational rehabilitation assessment is required when it can be reasonably determined that the injured worker will, as a result of the injury, be unable to resume the regular duties in which he or she was engaged at the time of injury. When the period of total incapacity for work exceeds 365 days, the written assessment required by this subsection shall likewise be prepared.
b) The assessment shall address the necessity for a plan or program that may include medical and vocational evaluation, modified or limited duty, and/or retraining, as necessary.
c) At least every 4 months thereafter, or until the matter is terminated by Order or Award of the Commission or by written agreement of the parties approved by the Commission, the employer, or his or her representative, in consultation with the employee and, if represented, with his or her representative, shall:
1) if the most recent previous assessment concluded that no plan or program was then necessary, prepare a written review of the continued appropriateness of that conclusion; or
2) if a plan or program had been developed, prepare a written review of the continued appropriateness of that plan or program, and make in writing any necessary modifications.
d) A copy of each written assessment, plan or program, review and modification shall be provided to the employee and/or his or her representative at the time of preparation, and an additional copy shall be retained in the file of the employer and, if insured, in the file of the insurance carrier. Copies shall be made available for review by the Commission, on its request, until the matter is terminated by Order or Award of the Commission or by written agreement of the parties approved by the Commission.
e) The rehabilitation plan may be prepared on a form furnished by the Commission.
f) Nothing in this Section abridges the rights of the parties.

--->illinois--->Illinois Rules--->PART 9110 MISCELLANEOUS--->Section 9110.90 Illinois Workers' Compensation Commission Medical Fee Schedule
===================================================================



 




Section 9110.90 Illinois Workers' Compensation Commission Medical Fee Schedule
			a) In accordance with Sections 8(a), 8.2 and 16 of the Workers' Compensation Act [820 ILCS 305/8(a), 8.2 and 16] (the Act), the Illinois Workers' Compensation Commission Medical Fee Schedule, including payment rates, instructions, guidelines, and payment guides and policies regarding application of the schedule, is adopted as a fee schedule to be used in setting the maximum allowable payment for procedures, treatment, products, services or supplies for hospital inpatient, hospital outpatient, emergency room, ambulatory surgical treatment centers, accredited ambulatory surgical treatment facilities, prescriptions filled and dispensed outside of a licensed pharmacy, dental services and professional services covered under the Act. The fee schedule is published on the Internet at no charge to the user via a link from the Commission's website at www.iwcc.il.gov. The fee schedule may be examined at any of the offices of the Illinois Workers' Compensation Commission.
			b) The payment rates for procedures, services or treatments in the fee schedule were established in accordance with Section 8.2 of the Act by determining 90% of the 80th percentile of charges utilizing health care provider and hospital charges from August 1, 2002 through August 1, 2004. The charges were adjusted by the Consumer Price Index-U for the period August 1, 2004 through September 30, 2005. For procedures, treatments, services or supplies covered under the Act and rendered or to be rendered on or after September 1, 2011, the maximum allowable payment shall be 70% of the fee schedule amounts, which shall be adjusted yearly by the Consumer Price Index-U. The payment rates in the fee schedule are designated by geozip (geographic area in which all zip codes have the same first 3 digits). Starting January 1, 2012, the payment rates in the fee schedule shall be grouped into geographic regions pursuant to Section 8.2 of the Act.
			c) The fee schedule applies to any medical procedure, treatment or service covered by the Act and rendered on or after February 1, 2006, regardless of the date of injury.
			d) Under the fee schedule, the employer pays the lesser of the rate set forth in the schedule or the provider's actual charge. If an employer or insurance carrier contracts with a provider for the purpose of providing services under the Act, the rate negotiated in the contract shall prevail.
			e) Reimbursement Not Covered by Fee Schedule
			1) Prior to September 1, 2011, whenever the fee schedule does not set a specific fee for a procedure, treatment or service in the schedule, the amount of reimbursement shall be at 76% of actual charge, except where

A standard chargemaster is the provider's list of charges for procedures, services and supplies used to bill payers in a consistent manner. If the provider cannot use the chargemaster to demonstrate the charge is the provider's normal rate, the provider shall provide evidence that the charge is billed at the provider's normal rate.
			2) On and after September 1, 2011, whenever the fee schedule does not set a specific fee for a procedure, treatment or service in the schedule, the amount of reimbursement shall be at 53.2% of actual charge, except where this Section provides that revenue codes (codes that identify a specific accommodation or ancillary charge on a UB-04/CMS 1450 uniform billing form used by hospitals) are to be deducted from the charge and reimbursed at 65% of charge billed at the provider's normal rates under its standard chargemaster. A standard chargemaster is the provider's list of charges for procedures, services and supplies used to bill payers in a consistent manner. If the provider cannot use the chargemaster to demonstrate the charge is the provider's normal rate, the provider shall provide evidence that the charge is billed at the provider's normal rate.
			f) Reimbursement under the fee schedule for a procedure, treatment or service, as designated by the geozip or region where the treatment occurred, shall be based on the place of service.

			1) Procedure Codes
			A) Prior to June 28, 2011, if the procedure, treatment or service is rendered outside the State of Illinois, the amount of reimbursement shall be the greater of 76% of actual charge or the amount set forth in a workers' compensation medical fee schedule adopted by the state in which the procedure, treatment or service is rendered, if such a schedule has been adopted. Charges for a procedure, treatment or service outside the State shall be subject to the instructions, guidelines, and payment guides and policies in this fee schedule.
			B) On and after June 28, 2011, providers of out-of-state procedures, treatments, services, products, or supplies shall be reimbursed at
			the lesser of that state's fee schedule amount or the fee schedule amount for the region in which the employee resides. If no fee schedule exists in that state, the provider shall be reimbursed at the lesser of the actual charge or the fee schedule amount for the region in which the employee resides. If the employee does not reside in this State, providers of out-of-state treatments, services, products or supplies shall be reimbursed at the lesser of the actual charge or the fee schedule amount for the location of the hearing site. "Hearing site" means the location established by the Commission for arbitration and Commission hearings.

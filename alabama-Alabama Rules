--->alabama--->Alabama Rules--->Chapter 480-5-1 General Provisions--->480-5-1-.08 Policies And Procedures For Mediation Of Workers' Compensation Disputes By An Ombudsman
===================================================================

 
  480-5-1-.08 Policies And Procedures For Mediation Of Workers' Compensation Disputes By An Ombudsmen. (1) Agreement of Parties - Mediation is a process where the parties to a dispute, with the help of an impartial third party (the "mediator"), attempt to work out a mutually satisfactory settlement of the dispute. Mediation is a process whereby either party may terminate the mediation at any time. Neither the Department of Industrial Relations (DIR) nor any mediator has the power of authority to force the parties to mediate or to accept an agreement or settlement. (2) Initiating the Mediation Process - To begin the mediation process, either party should contact the DIR. When all parties have acknowledged a willingness to mediate, they will then enter into an Agreement to Mediate, and an Ombudsmen shall inform all parties of their rights and responsibilities under the Workers' Compensation Act of Alabama. (3) Appointment of a Mediator - Following an agreement of the parties to mediate, DIR will select a mediator from its ombudsmen. No Person shall serve as a mediator in any dispute in which that person has any financial or personal interest in the result of the mediation. Prior to accepting an appointment, the prospective mediator shall disclose any circumstances likely to create a presumption of bias or interest in the outcome of the proceedings, or prevent a prompt meeting with the parties. The fact that the selected mediator may already have some familiarity with the case through work as an ombudsmen shall not disqualify the ombudsmen as a mediator unless either party objects to such mediator. In the event that a mediator is objected to, the DIR will select a new mediator from its ombudsmen. If a mediator is not able to continue the mediation process once started, the DIR will select another mediator from its ombudsmen. (4) Scheduling - Upon appointment, the mediator will work with the parties to establish the time and location of a mediation session. Additional mediation sessions may be scheduled as agreed by the parties and the mediator. (5) Conduct of Mediation Sessions - Prior to the first scheduled session the mediator may require the parties to provide the mediator with a brief memorandum setting forth the party's position with regard to the issues that need to be resolved. At the direction of the mediator, the memorandum may be exchanged by the parties. (a) At the first session, the parties shall produce all information reasonably required for the mediator to understand the issues presented. The mediator may require either party to supplement this information. (b) At the mediation session(s), the mediator will conduct an orderly settlement negotiation. Parties shall be represented by a person with authority to settle the case. The mediator will be impartial in such proceedings and has no authority to force the parties to agree to a settlement. The mediator may conduct separate meetings (caucus) with each party in order to improve the mediator's understanding of the respective positions of each party or to move the mediation process forward. The mediator shall not disclose to the adverse party confidential information provided by a party unless that party authorizes the disclosure. (6) Authority of Mediator - The mediator does not have authority to impose a settlement upon the parties, but shall attempt to help the parties reach a satisfactory resolution of their dispute. The mediator may direct questions to any of the parties or their representatives to supplement or clarify information. Whenever necessary, the mediator may obtain expert advice concerning technical aspects of the dispute. Arrangements for obtaining such advice shall be made by the mediator or by the parties. The mediator is authorized to end the mediation whenever, in the judgment of the mediator, further efforts at mediation would not contribute to a resolution of the dispute between the parties. (7) Privacy - Mediation sessions are private. The parties and their representatives may attend mediation sessions. Other persons may attend only with permission of the parties and with the consent of the mediator. (8) Confidentiality - The mediator shall not divulge information disclosed to the mediator by the parties or by witnesses in the course of mediation. All records, reports, or other documents received by a mediator or prepared by the mediator while serving as a mediator shall be considered confidential. The mediator shall not be compelled in any adversary proceeding or judicial forum to divulge the contents of such documents or the fact that such documents exist or testify in regard to the mediation. (a) The parties recognize that mediation sessions are settlement negotiations and that all offers, promises, conduct and statements, whether written or oral, made in the course of the proceedings are confidential and inadmissible in any litigation or arbitration of their dispute, including, but not limited to: views expressed or settlement suggestions made by the parties or the mediator; admissions made by any party; responsibility for termination or failure of the mediation process; or the fact that one party backed out of a settlement before it became binding on the parties. By participating in the mediation process; or the fact that one party backed out of a settlement before it became binding on the parties. By participating in the mediation process, the parties agree not to subpoena or otherwise require the mediator to testify or produce records, notes or work product in any adversarial proceedings between the parties. Any party that attempts to obtain such confidential information shall, and hereby agrees to, reimburse the mediator and the DIR for all fees and costs associated with resisting said attempts. However, evidence that is otherwise admissible or discoverable shall not be rendered inadmissible or non-discoverable as a result of its use in the mediation session. (b) In the event the parties do reach a settlement agreement during the mediation which becomes final and binding in accordance with the provisions of Section 39 of Act No. 92-537, that settlement agreement will be admissible in court or arbitration proceedings to enforce it. (9) No record - There shall be no formal record made of the mediation proceedings and no recordings or stenographic records shall be made. (10) Counsel - The parties may be represented by an attorney at any stage of the mediation process. An employee shall be advised at the first mediation session of his or her right to be represented by counsel by a writing which shall be notarized. (11) Settlement - If a dispute is resolved in whole or in part during mediation, the ombudsmen shall reduce the agreement in writing, and the ombudsmen and each party shall sign the agreement. The signed agreement shall be binding on all parties unless within 60 days after the agreement is signed a court of competent jurisdiction relieves all parties of the effect of the agreement because of fraud, newly discovered evidence, or other good cause. At the end of said 60 day period, the agreement shall be final and irrevocable. At any time during the 60 day period, the parties may present the settlement agreement to a court of competent jurisdiction for approval in accordance with the Workers' Compensation Act of Alabama. (a) At the first mediation session the employee shall be advised by the ombudsmen in writing which is notarized that he or she have a right to have any settlement or his or her claim reviewed by a court of competent jurisdiction at any time within 60 days after the date of the settlement and that at the end of 60 days the settlement shall be final and irrevocable. (12) Termination - The mediation shall be terminated by the parties reaching a settlement; by a declaration by the mediator to the effect that, in the opinion of the mediator, further efforts at mediation are no longer worthwhile; or by a declaration by any party, at any time, that the mediation proceedings are terminated.

Public utilities are eligible for membership in the Alabama Workers' Compensation Self-Insurer's Guaranty Association or shall furnish and maintain security in any amount determined by the Director in the form of a cash deposit with the Alabama State Treasury or other approved securities.
(a) The Director shall determine the Guaranty Association security amount for each employer authorized to operate as a self-insured at the time of the issuance of the certificate, and the security amount required of each self-insured employer will be reviewed throughout the period during which the certificate remains in effect. The Guaranty Association security amount shall be predicated on the self-insured's satisfactory proof to the Department of the self-insurer's financial strength and ability to pay all benefits and costs as required by the provisions of the Alabama Workers' Compensation Act. The security amount required of any individual self-insurer may be increased for good cause at the Director's discretion, at any time.

(7) Administration of Self-Insured Claims - Every self-insured employer shall conduct the administration of its self-insured claims program through the services of a competent administrator or administrative agency or company located in Alabama.

Failure to notify the Director of the proposed change shall constitute good cause for revocation of the certificate of self-insurance.
(a) Self-insured employers are required to set reserves for claims in an amount deemed to be sufficient to pay any and all claims expense which may reasonably be expected to be incurred. Those reserves are to be independently verified by an independent actuary once every three (3) years.

(8) Reports - In addition to all reports required by the Workers' Compensation Act, and required elsewhere in these rules, each employer authorized to operate as a self-insurer must file with the Division a loss summary for the year giving totals for compensation and medical expenses paid during the year regardless of injury date and reserves, and a copy of the most recent, certified, independently audited financial statement with accompanying financial notes for the financial year then ended.
(a) The Director, or the designee of the Director, or any contract designee of the Director, may, for good cause, at any time, examine, review, audit, or inspect all books and records of any self-insured or self insured applicant to determine the claims liability, the workers' compensation claims paying ability, the financial condition in relation to the claims paying ability, and to ascertain the workers' compensation administrative trust fund assessment liability. Any self-insurer that refuses to allow the Director, or his or her designee, to examine or audit any books or records shall be subject to revocation of the certificate of self-insurance, and to any other penalty allowed by law or regulation. Any applicant for self-insurance who refuses to provide any reports or documentation requested by the Director, or who refuses to allow the Director or his or her designee to examine, inspect, or audit any books or records so requested by the Director shall be denied a certificate of self-insurance.
(b) All required reports, documents or requested information must be received by the division no later than ninety (90) days after the close of a self-insured's financial year. A self-insured employer may ask for a ninety (90) day extension in which to file a required report or document. Failure to submit a required report within ninety (90) days after the close of the self-insured's financial year, or within one hundred eighty (180) days if a ninety (90) day extension is granted, will subject the self-insured entity to an administrative penalty of $50.00 per day for each day the required report is late for a maximum of thirty (30) days, at which time revocation proceedings will begin. This paragraph applies to all current and future self-insured entities. 
(9) Cancellation or Revocation of Authority to Self-Insure: - The Director may revoke a certificate of self-insurance or may deny an application for self-insurance for failure to comply with any provision of this regulation, or for failure to comply with any other laws or regulations, or for other good cause.

(b) The Director may revoke the certificate of self-insurance for failure to pay any Guaranty Association fees, assessments, or security amounts, within the time prescribed.
(c) The Director may revoke the certificate of self-insurance for any self-insured that submits false information regarding the workers' compensation administrative trust fund assessment, or that hinders the Departments determination or verification of the trust fund assessment amount, including the failure to file a first report of injury.
(d) Any self- insured employer who is required by these rules or who desires to have its authority to self-insure cancelled, may do so by furnishing to the Director, at least thirty (30) days prior to the proposed date on which the cancellation is to become effective, notice of the desired action. Upon cancellation of self-insurance status, an employer, if legally required to do so, must have and maintain workers' compensation insurance in accordance with the Alabama workers' compensation laws.
(e) The authority to self-insure may be revoked by the Director for financial reasons or for failure of the employer to faithfully discharge his obligations according to the agreements contained in his application for authority to self-insure, or for continued violations of these rules or the workers' compensation laws or other regulations as prescribed by the Director in accordance with Code of Ala. 1975, Â§25-5-8(d) as last amended. Any such employer shall provide the Director with any and all assistance, material and information, documentation or claims files or claims information which may be reasonably required to enable the Director to determine the total amount of claims liability, including IBNR claims, and outstanding future liabilities incurred by the employer. The cancellation or revocation of the authority to self-insure will be ineffective as to any claims which were incurred by an employer during the period in which the Certificate remained in effect.
(f) Upon cancellation, voluntary or otherwise, or revocation of a self-insurance certificate, any security held by the Director will continue to be held by the director until all Alabama workers' compensation claims have been paid or settled. 
(10) Notice - Any notice required to be given by these rules and regulations to the Director shall be deemed proper if made in writing, addressed to Director, Department of Industrial Relations, Workers' Compensation Division, Montgomery, Alabama, 36131. Any notice required by these rules and regulations to be given to a self-insured employer shall be deemed properly given if in writing and addressed to the employer at the address shown on either the application or the last annual report.

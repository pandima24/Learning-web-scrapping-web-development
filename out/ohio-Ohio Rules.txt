===================================================================



 

4121-4-02 Procedures for accessing confidential personal information.
For personal information systems, whether manual or computer systems that contain confidential personal information, the commission shall do the following:
(A) Criteria for accessing confidential personal information. Personal information systems of the commission are managed on a "need-to-know" basis whereby the information owner determines the level of access required for an employee of the commission to fulfill his or her job duties. The determination of access to confidential personal information shall be approved by the employee's supervisor and the information owner prior to providing the employee with access to confidential personal information within a personal information system. The commission shall establish procedures for determining a revision to an employee's access to confidential personal information upon a change to that employee's job duties including, but not limited to, transfer or termination. Whenever an employee's job duties no longer require access to confidential personal information in a personal information system, the employee's access to confidential personal information shall be removed.
(B) Individual's request for a list of confidential personal information. Upon the signed written request of any individual for a list of confidential personal information about the individual maintained by the commission, the commission shall do all of the following:
(1) Verify the identity of the individual by a method that provides safeguards commensurate with the risk associated with the confidential personal information;
(2) Provide to the individual the list of confidential personal information that does not relate to an investigation about the individual or is otherwise not excluded from the scope of Chapter 1347. of the Revised Code; and
(3) If all information relates to an investigation about that individual, inform the individual that the commission has no confidential personal information about the individual that is responsive to the individual's request.
(C) Notice of invalid access.
(1) Upon discovery or notification that confidential personal information of a person has been accessed by an employee of the commission for an invalid reason, the commission shall notify the person whose information was invalidly accessed as soon as practical and to the extent known at the time. However, the commission shall delay notification for a period of time necessary to ensure that the notification would not delay or impede an investigation or jeopardize homeland or national security. Additionally, the commission may delay the notification consistent with any measures necessary to determine the scope of the invalid access, including which individuals' confidential personal information invalidly was accessed, and to restore the reasonable integrity of the system.
"Investigation" as used in this paragraph means the investigation of the circumstances and involvement of an employee surrounding the invalid access of the confidential personal information. Once the commission determines that notification would not delay or impede an investigation, the commission shall disclose the access to confidential personal information made for an invalid reason to the person.
(2) Notification provided by the commission shall inform the person of the type of confidential personal information accessed and the date(s) of the invalid access.
(3) Notification may be made by any method reasonably designed to accurately inform the person of the invalid access, including written, electronic, or telephone notice.
(D) Appointment of a data privacy point of contact. The chairperson shall designate an employee of the commission to serve as the data privacy point of contact. The data privacy point of contact shall work with the chief privacy officer within the office of information technology to assist the commission with both the implementation of privacy protections for the confidential personal information that the commission maintains and compliance with section 1347.15 of the Revised Code and the rules adopted pursuant to the authority provided by that chapter.
(E) Completion of a privacy impact assessment. The chairperson shall designate an employee of the commission to serve as the data privacy point of contact who shall timely complete the privacy impact assessment form developed by the office of information technology.

===================================================================



 

4121-15-02 Policy.
(A) It is essential that the public has confidence in the administration of the industrial commission and the bureau of workers' compensation. This public confidence depends in a large degree on whether the public trusts that employees of these agencies are impartial, fair, and act only in the interest of the people, uninfluenced by any consideration of self-interest, except those inherent in the proper performance of their duties. Each employee, of whatever position, should, therefore, maintain the highest standards of personal integrity, since the public often judges the actions of an employee as reflecting the standards of the employing agency.
(B) The industrial commission and the bureau of workers' compensation are entrusted with the collection and distribution of a large fund. Their employees must respect this trust and should welcome public scrutiny of the way in which they perform their duties in connection with the administration of this fund. They should be willing to accept restrictions on their conduct that may not be necessary of public employees in other agencies, who are not in similar position of trust. They must avoid not only impropriety, but the appearance of impropriety.

(a) Solicit or accept anything of value from anyone doing business with the commission or the bureau;

(f) Hold or benefit from a contract with, authorized by, or approved by the commission or the bureau, (the ethics law does accept some limited stockholdings, and some contracts objectively shown as the lowest cost services, where all criteria under section 2921.42 of the Revised Code are met);

(h) Solicit or accept honoraria (see division (H) of section 102.01 and division (H) of section 202.03 of the Revised Code) except that employees who are not financial disclosure filers may receive an honorarium only if the honorarium is paid in recognition of a demonstrable business, profession, or esthetic interest of the employee that exists apart from public office or employment, and is not paid by any person or other entity, or by a representative or association of those persons or entities, doing business with the commission or the bureau, as applicable;

(m) Sponsor parties or other entertainment for the personnel of their agencies, the cost of which are covered in whole or in part by donations or receipts from the sale of tickets to individuals or entities, who are doing or seeking to do business with the commission or bureau.
(2) For purposes of this rule, these phrases have the following meanings:
(a) "Anything of value" includes anything of monetary value, including, but not limited to, money, loans, gifts, food or beverages, social event tickets and expenses, travel expenses, golf outings, consulting fees, compensation, or employment. "Value" means worth greater than de minimis or nominal.
(b) "Anyone doing business with the commission or the bureau" includes, but is not limited to, any person, corporation, or other party that is doing or seeking to do business with, regulated by, or has interests before the commission or the bureau, including anyone who is known or should be known to be an agent or acting on behalf of such party, including any person or entity marketing or otherwise attempting to secure business with the commission or the bureau
(c) "Compensation" means money, thing of value, or financial benefit. "Compensation" does not include reimbursement for actual and necessary expenses incurred in the performance of official duties.

(D) Professional code of ethics In the event there is any conflict between a professional code of ethics governing any employee of these agencies and this code of ethics for employees, the professional code of ethics shall take precedence over the code of ethics for employees but the conflict shall be promptly reported to the employing agency. In such case the agency shall promptly determine the degree of conflict and take such further action as may be indicated.
(9) An employee shall not use state property of any kind for other than approved activities. The employee shall not misuse or deface state property. The taking or use of state property for the private purposes of an employee is prohibited. The employee shall protect and conserve all state property, including equipment and supplies entrusted to or issued to the employee.
(F) Diligence and impartiality in work Employees are encouraged to avoid absenteeism and tardiness, to not use sick leave unless necessary and to abide by rules of the Ohio civil service. Recognizing that the industrial commission and bureau of workers' compensation serve many people whose interests are divergent, employees should work in a speedy and efficient manner, strive to be courteous, fair and impartial to the people they serve, and responsive to the problems that come before them. All segments of the public are to be treated equally, without regard to age, race, sex, religion, country of origin, or handicap.
(G) It is understood that standards of ethical conduct may involve a myriad of situations. The good conscience of individual employees shall remain the best guarantee of the moral quality of their activities. The overall intent of this code of ethics is that employees avoid any action, whether or not prohibited by the preceding provisions, which result in, or create the appearance of:
(1) Using public office for private gain, or
(2) Giving preferential treatment to any person, entity, or group.
(H) Confidential information The confidentiality of all information which comes into possession of commission and bureau employees shall be respected.

Furthermore, they must become familiar with the circumstances under which and the persons to whom such information can be released.
(I) Every member or employee required to file a financial disclosure statement must file a complete and accurate statement with the Ohio ethics commission by April fifteen of each year. Any member or employee appointed, or employed in a filing position after February fifteen of each year and required to file a financial disclosure statement must file a statement must file a statement within ninety days of appointment or employment

4123-3-07 Applications for death benefits.
When the death of an employee is the result of an industrial injury or occupational disease, the employee's dependents may file an application for death benefits. To be considered a "dependent", a person must be a member of the family of the deceased employee, or bear to the employee the relation of surviving spouse, lineal descendant, ancestor, or brother or sister. Generally, lineal descent is descent in a direct or right line, as from father or grandfather to son or grandson, etc. to the remotest degree. An application signed by a person claiming to be a dependent, as described herein, shall be accepted for filing and shall be sufficient to initiate proceedings for workers' compensation benefits and to obtain a ruling on the validity of the claim. If there are no dependents, the application may be filed by the estate of the deceased employee, the attending physician, the funeral director, by a volunteer paying the funeral bill, by a person who authorized the burial and funeral expenses or by the employer, for services rendered because of the injury or occupational disease causing the employee's death.

--->ohio--->Ohio Rules--->Chapter 4123: Bureau of Workers' Compensation--->Chapter 4123-3 Claims Procedure--->4123-3-08 Preparation and filing of applications for compensation and/or benefits.
===================================================================



 

4123-3-08 Preparation and filing of applications for compensation and/or benefits.
(A) Preparation and execution of forms.
(1) The "First Report of Injury" form (FROI-1) or equivalent for applying for payment from the state insurance fund due to an injury, occupational disease, or death may be completed by the employee, employer, medical provider, or other interested party . If someone other than the employee submits a FROI-1 or equivalent, the bureau may contact the employee to attempt to verify that the employee wishes to pursue the application. To accept or deny the validity of the claim, the employer may complete and sign the form at the designated point or may use a separate writing, telephone, or other means of telecommunication.
(2) The FROI-1 for applying for payment from a self-insuring employer shall be completed, signed by the employee , and returned to the self-insuring employer. In situations where there is no prescribed form, a notice in writing shall be given in a manner sufficient to inform that a claim for benefits is being presented.
(3) An injured or disabled employee who is a minor (under eighteen years of age) shall file a claim in his or her own name and right. A report of injury signed by such minor employee shall be sufficient to initiate proceedings for compensation and/or benefits.
(4) In the event the injured or disabled employee is unable to complete the first report of injury by reason of physical or mental disability, the report may be completed and filed by the employee's spouse, next friend, the guardian of the employee, or the employee's employer. In claims for death benefits where the dependents are a spouse and one or more minor children, it shall be sufficient for the spouse to make application for benefits on behalf of the spouse and the minor children. In the event a dependent minor child has a guardian of the person other than the spouse of the deceased, such guardian shall execute the report on behalf of such minor child. If there is no spouse surviving, the report on behalf of the dependent minor children, or children who are mentally or physically incapacitated, may be filed by a guardian or next friend of such children.
(5) It shall be the duty of every employer to assist injured or disabled employees in the preparation and submission of reports for compensation and/or benefits. In the event that the employer refuses, neglects or unduly delays the completion of a report, the report may be filed without the part pertaining to the employer having been completed. The fact of refusal or neglect should be noted upon the report or with it by way of separate letter.
(6) In cases where the death of the employee is not the result of injury or occupational disease, an application for accrued compensation may be made as provided in sections 4123.57 and 4123.60 of the Revised Code.
(7) Application for payment of the balance of percentage permanent partial disability compensation, awarded under division (A) of section 4123.57 of the Revised Code prior to the employee's death, shall be made by the injured employee's dependents. The application may be filed whether the death was related or unrelated to an industrial injury or occupational disease.
(B) Certification by the employer.
(1) An employer shall accept or reject the validity of a claim filed against its risk within the time as required by sections 4123.511 and 4123.84 of the Revised Code and the rules of the industrial commission and bureau of workers' compensation. If the employer fails to comply with the established time limits, the bureau shall take such further action in the claim as provided for by section 4123.511 of the Revised Code and the rules of the industrial commission and the bureau.
(2) If the employer accepts or denies the validity of the claim, the employer may sign the report at the designated point and return the requested information to the bureau, or the bureau may obtain the employer's certification or denial of the claim by a separate writing, by telephone, or by other forms of telecommunication.
If the employer denies the validity of the claim, the employer shall state the reasons for rejecting the validity of the claim.
(3) Certification by the employer in state fund cases shall not be determinative of compensability. Every such claim is subject to administrative review as to compensability.
(4) An employer's certification of a claim may be made by the employer, by an officer of the business entity which is the employer, or by a duly designated representative of the employer. The person certifying a claim for the employer shall indicate in what capacity the person is employed (title). No other person or entity may make such certification. No person may certify his or her own claim, except in cases of a sole proprietor who has obtained coverage as an employee within Chapter 4123. of the Revised Code.
(C) Place and manner of filing applications for benefits. Any first report of injury shall be accepted for filing in any office of the bureau or industrial commission during working hours, and reports may be filed by mail or reported by telecommunication.
(D) Time limitations within which claims must be filed.
(1) Injury claims applying for compensation and/or benefits shall be in writing or by telecommunication as provided for in division (E) of section 4123.84 of the Revised Code, and shall include the specific part or parts of the body alleged to have been injured, the injured worker's name and address, and the date of injury. Such claims shall be forever barred unless said written notice is filed with the bureau of workers' compensation or the industrial commission within two years from the date when injured, unless the applicable statute of limitations is extended due to the employer's failure to file a report as required by section 4123.28 of the Revised Code. Except as provided in paragraph (D)(3) of this rule, any claim or application for compensation and/or benefits for an injury to any part or parts of the body not specified in the original claim will be barred unless written notice of the additional part or parts of the body claimed to have been injured is filed by the claimant with the bureau of workers' compensation or the industrial commission within two years of the date when injured.
(2) In self-insuring employers' claims, the two-year time limitation is tolled if the employer has provided treatment by a licensed physician in the employ of the employer or has paid compensation or benefits within the period. "Benefits" means payment by the self-insuring employer to, or on behalf of, an employee for:
(a) A hospital bill;
(b) A medical bill for treatment by a licensed physician, other than a salaried physician in the employ of the self-insuring employer;
(c) An orthopedic or prosthetic device.
(3) The bureau of workers' compensation and the industrial commission have continuing jurisdiction over a claim which meets the requirement of section 4123.84 of the Revised Code, including jurisdiction to award compensation and/or benefits for a condition (or conditions) or disability developing in part or parts of the body not specified pursuant to division (A)(1) of section 4123.84 of the Revised Code, if it is found that the condition (or conditions) or disability was due to and a result of or a residual of the injury to one of the parts of the body set forth in the written notice filed pursuant to division (A)(1) of section 4123.84 of the Revised Code.
(4) Claims for occupational disease must be filed within two years after the disability begins, or within such longer period as does not exceed six months after diagnosis by a licensed physician, as provided in section 4123.85 of the Revised Code, excepting claims enumerated in paragraph (D)(5) of this rule, other than berylliosis, or where the applicable statute of limitations is extended due to the employer's failure to file a report as required by section 4123.28 of the Revised Code. The filing limitation of six months after diagnosis, where it applies, can only lengthen, not shorten, the two-year statute of limitations.
(5) Special statutory provisions (section 4123.68 of the Revised Code) exist as to claims for silicosis, cardiovascular and pulmonary diseases of fire fighters and police officers, coal miners' pneumoconiosis, asbestosis, berylliosis, radiation illness and all other occupational diseases of the respiratory tract resulting from injurious exposures to dust:
(a) Compensation is payable in silicosis, coal miners' pneumoconiosis, cardiovascular and pulmonary disease of fire fighters and police officers and in all other dust caused diseases of the respiratory tract, except berylliosis, only for temporary total or permanent total disability or death and only if such disability and/or death occurs within eight years after the last injurious exposure.
(b) If disability or death is from injurious exposure occurring after January 1, 1976, the eight-year limitation shall not apply.
(c) There must be injurious exposure in this state. In cases of cardiovascular and pulmonary disease of fire fighters and/or police officers, some of this must be after January 1, 1967. In cases of silicosis, asbestosis and coal miners' pneumoconiosis, part of the injurious exposure must be after October 12, 1945.
(d) In the event of death following continuous total disability commencing within eight years after the last injurious exposure, the requirement of death within eight years does not apply.
(e) The above provisions govern asbestosis claims except that the eight-year limitation does not apply.
(f) The above provisions govern berylliosis and radiation claims except that payment of compensation is not restricted to temporary total, permanent total disability and/or death, and that exposure in this state is not required for radiation claims. In radiation claims, where disability began prior to November 2, 1959, the general occupational disease provisions apply.
(g) The above claims, except claims for berylliosis, must be filed within one year after total disability begins or within such longer period as does not exceed six months after diagnosis by a licensed physician. Claims for berylliosis must be filed within the time as provided in paragraph (D)(4) of this rule. If the disability due to the disease began on or after January 1, 1979, or was diagnosed by a licensed physician on or after January 1, 1979, such claims shall be forever barred unless, within two years after the date of disability due to the disease, or within such longer period as does not exceed six months after diagnosis of the occupational disease by a licensed physician, application is made to the industrial commission, the bureau, or to the employer in the event such employer has elected to pay compensation or benefits directly, or the applicable statute of limitations is extended due to the employer's failure to file a report as required by section 4123.28 of the Revised Code.
(6) Death claims, alleging that death is the result of injury, must be filed within two years of death or be forever barred, except as provided in paragraphs (D)(8) and (D)(9) of this rule.
(7) Where the death is due to an occupational disease and death occurred on or after November 2, 1959, the claim must be filed within two years of the death, as provided in section 4123.85 of the Revised Code.
(8) Emergency management claims for injury or death must be filed within one year from the date when injured or from the date of death, or be forever barred. If an injury claim has been filed within the one-year period and the claimant subsequently dies, a death claim must be filed within six months after the death or be forever barred.
(9) Public works relief employees' claims must be filed within two years after the date when injured or the date of death, or be forever barred.
(10) Militia claims, special contract claims and apprentice claims are governed by the general time limits applicable to injury and occupational disease claims, as provided by sections 4123.84 and 4123.85 of the Revised Code.

--->ohio--->Ohio Rules--->Chapter 4123: Bureau of Workers' Compensation--->Chapter 4123-3 Claims Procedure--->4123-3-09 Procedures in the processing of applications for benefits.
===================================================================



 

4123-3-09 Procedures in the processing of applications for benefits.
(A) Numbering and recording.
(1) Upon receipt, the bureau will assign a claim number to each initial application for benefits. The bureau shall provide the claim number to the claimant and employer. In cases where a deceased employee has filed, during his or her lifetime, an industrial claim for the injury or disability which is the subject matter of the death claim, the application for death benefits shall be assigned the original claim number.
(2) The claim number should be placed on all documents subsequently filed in each claim and the claim number should be given when inquiry is made concerning each claim.
(B) Initial review and processing of new claims. Immediately after numbering and recording, all new claim applications, except applications of employees of self-insuring employers, shall be reviewed and processed by the bureau. "Processing on the question of compensability" means making a determination on the validity of the industrial claim.
(1) Uncontested or undisputed claims. A "contested or disputed claim," as used herein, is where the employer or the bureau of workers' compensation questions the validity of a claim for compensation or benefits. No claim shall be regarded as a contested or a disputed claim requiring a formal (public) hearing, solely by reason of incomplete information, unless every effort has been made to complete the record.
(a) If a state fund claim meets the statutory requirements of compensability, the claims specialist shall have authority to approve such claim for payment of medical bills and temporary total disability compensation or other appropriate compensation. The approval of the claim must contain the description of the condition or conditions for which the claim is being allowed and part or parts of the body affected.
(b) In the processing of initial applications in state fund claims, requesting payment of compensation in addition to medical benefits, the claims specialist may approve temporary total disability compensation over a period not to exceed four weeks, without medical proof in the record, provided that the application has been properly completed and signed, certified by the employer and was otherwise noncontroversial. If medical proof was submitted with the initial application, the above limitation shall not apply. Upon approval of the claim the claimant shall be notified in writing that his or her attending physician's report will be necessary for consideration of any additional payment of compensation and an appropriate form shall be enclosed, with the necessary instructions, for the claimant's convenience.
(2) Contested or disputed claims.
(a) Contested or disputed claims as well as claims requiring investigation shall be referred, immediately after the initial review, to the appropriate office of the bureau from which investigation and determination of issues may be made most expeditiously.
(b) If the bureau or the employer contests the claim application and the claimant is not available for an adjudication due to the claimant's service in the armed services of the United States, the bureau shall continue the matter in accordance with the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act until the claimant is available for adjudication of the claim.
(3) Applications for death benefits.Immediately after numbering and recording, all applications for death benefits shall be referred to the appropriate office of the bureau from which investigation and determination of issues may be made most expeditiously. Every effort should be made to complete the investigation within the shortest time possible, depending on the facts and circumstances of each particular case, to enable prompt adjudication of such claims by the bureau.
(4) Contested (disputed) applications for workers' compensation benefits filed by employees of self-insuring employers shall be referred to the industrial commission for a hearing.
(C) Proof.
(1) In every instance the proof shall be of sufficient quantum and probative value to establish the jurisdiction of the bureau to consider the claim and determine the rights of the applicant to an award. "Quantum" means measurable quantity. "Probative" means having a tendency to prove or establish.
(2) Proof may be presented by affidavit, deposition, oral testimony, written statement, document, or other forms.
(3) The burden of proof is upon the claimant (applicant for workers' compensation benefits) to establish each essential element of the claim by preponderance of the evidence. Essential elements shall include, but will not be limited to:
(a) Establishing that the applicant is one of the persons who under the act have the right to file a claim for workers' compensation benefits;
(b) That the application was filed within the time period as required by law;
(c) That the alleged injury or occupational disease was sustained or contracted in the course of and arising out of employment;
(d) In death claims, that death was the direct and proximate result of an injury sustained or occupational disease contracted in the course of and arising out of employment; the necessary causal relationship between an injury or occupational disease and death may be established by submission of sufficient evidence to show that the injury or occupational disease aggravated or accelerated a pre-existing condition to such an extent that it substantially hastened death;
(e) Any other material issue in the claim, which means a question that must be established in order to determine claimant's right to compensation and/or benefits.
"Preponderance of the evidence" means greater weight of evidence, taking into consideration all the evidence presented. Burden of proof does not necessarily relate to the number of witnesses or quantity of evidence submitted, but to its quality, such as merit, credibility and weight. The obligation of the claimant is to make proof to the reasonable degree of probability. A mere possibility is conjectural, speculative and does not meet the required standard.
(4) The bureau or commission may, at any point in the processing of an application for benefits, require the employee to submit to a physical examination or may refer a claim for investigation.
(5) Procedure on employer's request for medical examination of the claimant by a doctor of employer's choice.
The employer may require a medical examination of the employee as provided in section 4123.651 of the Revised Code under the following circumstances:
(a) Such an examination, if requested, shall be in lieu of any rights under paragraph (C)(5)(b) of this rule and in no event will the claimant be examined on the same issue by a physician of the employer's choice more than one time. The exercise of this examination right shall not be allowed to delay the timely payment of benefits or scheduled hearings. Requests for further examinations will be made to the bureau or commission following the provisions of paragraph (C)(5)(b) of this rule. The cost of any examination initiated by the employer shall be paid by the employer including any fee required by the doctor, and the payment of all of the claimant's traveling and meal expenses, in a manner and at the rates as established by the bureau from time to time. If employed, the claimant will also be compensated for any loss of wages arising from the scheduling of an examination.
All reasonable expenses shall be paid by the employer immediately upon receipt of the billing, and the employer shall provide the claimant with a proper form to be completed by the claimant for reimbursement of such expenses.
The employer shall promptly inform the bureau or the commission, as well as the claimant's representative, as to the time and place of the examination, and the questions and information provided to the doctor. A copy of the examination report shall be submitted to the bureau or commission and to the claimant's representative upon the employer's receipt of the report from the doctor.
Emergency treatment does not constitute an examination by the employer for the purposes of this rule. Treatment by a company doctor as the treating physician constitutes an examination for the purposes of this rule. The procedure set forth in paragraph (C)(5)(a) of this rule shall be applicable to claims where the date of injury or the date of disability in occupational disease claims occur on or after August 22, 1986.
(b) If after one medical examination of the claimant under paragraph (C)(5)(a) of this rule, an employer asserts that a medical examination of the claimant by a doctor of the employer's choice is essential in the defense of the claim by the employer, a written request may be filed with the bureau for that purpose. In such request the employer shall state the date of the last examination of the claimant by a doctor of employer's choice on the question pending. If there was no such prior examination, the request must so indicate.
(c) If the claim is pending before the industrial commission or its hearing officers and the question sought to be clarified by such examination is not within the jurisdiction of the bureau (for example: permanent total disability), the request shall be referred, forthwith, to the industrial commission or to the appropriate hearing officer, as the case may be, for further consideration.
(d) If the question sought to be clarified by the requested examination is within the bureau's jurisdiction (for example: temporary total disability in otherwise undisputed claim, allowance of additional condition), the bureau shall immediately act upon the request.
If, upon a review of the claim file the bureau is of the opinion that the request should be denied for the reason that the claimant has been recently examined by a doctor of the employer's choice, or for any other reason indicating that further examination would not be pertinent to the defense of the claim, based on the facts and circumstances of each particular case, the matter shall be referred, forthwith, to the appropriate district hearing officer for further consideration. In cases of temporary total disability, a medical examination performed within the past thirty days shall be regarded as "recent." If the question involves additional allowance of claim for an additional condition allegedly causally related to the allowed injury or occupational disease, a medical examination performed within the past sixty to ninety days may be regarded as "recent," depending on the nature and type of the condition and/or disability.
(e) All reasonable expenses incurred by the claimant in submitting to such examination, including any travel expense that the claimant may properly incur, shall be paid by the employer immediately upon receipt of the billing. Payment for traveling expenses shall not require an order of the bureau or commission, unless there is a dispute. The employer shall provide the claimant with a proper form to be completed by the claimant for reimbursement for traveling expenses. In addition, if the request for such examination is filed on or after January 1, 1979, and the claimant sustains lost wages as a result of such examination, the employer shall reimburse the claimant for such lost wages within three weeks from the date of examination. Expenses incurred by the claimant and wages lost by reason of attending such examination are not to be paid in the claim.
(f) The employer shall make arrangements for such examination within fifteen days from the date of receipt of the order of approval. The examination shall be performed not later than within thirty days from the date of the receipt of approval.
The doctor's report shall be filed with the bureau immediately upon its receipt. Failure of the employer to comply with this rule shall not delay further action in the claim, unless it is established that the omission was due to causes beyond the employer's control.
(6) Procedure for obtaining the deposition of an examining physician. Authority to allow depositions is within the exclusive jurisdiction of the industrial commission. Any such request, if filed with the bureau, shall be referred, forthwith, to the industrial commission for further consideration.
(D) Hearings and orders .
(1) Unless required by law or by the circumstances of the claim, the claim shall be adjudicated without a formal hearing.
(2) Disputed or contested claims shall be set for a formal (public) hearing on the question of allowance before the district hearing officers. A "disputed or contested claim," as used herein, is where the employer or the claimant questions the decision of the bureau regarding a request for compensation or benefits. No claim shall be regarded as a contested or disputed claim requiring a formal (public) hearing, solely by reason of incomplete information unless every effort has been made to complete the record In the event the employer or claimant object to the decision of the bureau, such objection shall be made in writing with rationale and supporting evidence, as appropriate.
(3) The administrator or his or her designee may appear at such hearings to represent the interest of the state insurance fund and/or the surplus fund.
(4) The bureau shall make payment on orders of the commission, and district or staff hearing officers in accordance with law and rules of the bureau and the industrial commission.
(5) If the administrator or his or her designee is of the opinion that an emergency exists which requires an immediate hearing of a claim, he or she may request an emergency hearing. "Emergency," as used herein, means a sudden, generally unexpected occurrence or set of circumstances demanding immediate action. Such request shall be made in accordance with the rule of the industrial commission on emergency hearings as defined in rule 4121-3-30 of the Administrative Code.
(E) Representation of claimants and employers before the bureau. Representation of claimants and employers before the bureau is a matter of individual free choice. The bureau does not require representation nor does it prohibit it. No one other than an attorney at law, authorized to practice in the state of Ohio, shall be permitted to represent claimants for a fee before the bureau.
(F) If the bureau or the parties believe that clarification of issues will facilitate the processing of the claim, the claimant, employer, and their duly authorized representatives, as defined in rule 4123-3-22 of the Administrative Code, shall be given an opportunity to provide additional evidence on questions pertaining to the claim pending before the bureau.
The evidence shall be made a part of the claim file to be considered by the bureau when the determination is made on the issue pending before the bureau.

(b) When a claimant authorizes another person to pick up the claimant's compensation check, the authorization shall be an authorization to receive workers' compensation payment or equivalent. On all types of compensation, other than percentage of permanent partial compensation, the authorization must be filed prior to or at the hearing, or prior to the date of payment of the award of compensation, whether the award of compensation was made at a hearing or without a hearing. For authorization to receive compensation checks in connection with permanent partial disability applications and applications for increases thereof, the authorization must be filed with the application, with the agreement of permanent partial disability, with the election, or with the industrial commission at formal hearing or not later than prior to the date of mailing of the findings resulting from the formal hearing.

===================================================================



 

4123-3-11 Reports of payments by self-insuring employers.
(A) During the continuance of temporary total disability, temporary partial disability, or wage loss compensation caused by an injury or occupational disease, the employer shall, at the request of the bureau of workers' compensation or the industrial commission at any time or at the request of the claimant or claimant's representative where the issue of compensation is pending in a workers' compensation hearing or adjudication matter, file a report of compensation payments with the bureau showing the amount and type of compensation paid to such employee during the preceding period. The report shall indicate the date when the first installment of the type of compensation reported was paid.
(B) In the event an injury or occupational disease results in a disability compensable under division (A) or
(B) of section 4123.57 of the Revised Code, and an agreement has been entered into between the employee and the employer as to the compensation to be paid for such permanent partial disability, the agreement shall state when the first installment of such compensation is to be paid. Such agreement shall be signed by the employee and employer and shall be filed with the bureau as soon as it has been completed. Such agreement shall be accompanied by a report from the attending physician which shall indicate the extent of the permanent partial disability sustained.
(C) In cases of compensable death claims, where the employer and the dependents or legal representatives of a deceased employee agree that the death is compensable, and there being no question of apportionment of death benefits, they enter into an agreement in writing as to the benefits which are to be paid; such agreement shall be reported by the employer. It shall indicate the date of the first installment of payment, the weekly rate of death benefits, the period of time over which such benefits will be paid (lifetime or specific dates) and the total amount of benefits in cases where it is known. Such agreement shall be signed by the employer and the dependent, dependents, or legal representatives and shall be filed with the bureau within one month of the date of execution of the agreement. Such agreement shall include provision for the payment of appropriate funeral, medical, hospital and other expenses. Subsequent reports of the payment of death benefits shall be filed with the bureau at the request of the bureau or the commission at any time or at the request of the claimant or claimant's representative where the issue of compensation is pending in a workers' compensation hearing or adjudication matter. Should there be a change in death benefits as a result of changes in the dependency status of the recipients, employer's reports shall reflect same. In cases of compensable death claims, where the employer and the dependents or legal representatives of a deceased employee agree that the death is compensable but where there is a question of apportionment, the self-insuring employer may choose to pay death benefits before a hearing at the industrial commission. The first such payment should indicate to the beneficiaries that because there is a question of apportionment among the surviving spouse, dependent children, or other dependents, the commission must issue an order apportioning the payment; therefore, payments until such order issues are subject to an adjustment in accordance with the apportionment ordered by the commission among the beneficiaries at such time as the apportionment order issues. In other death claims approved for payment by the industrial commission or its hearing officers, the employer shall report payments in the same general manner as indicated above.
(D) In all claims, the self-insuring employer shall, upon completion of the payment of compensation and benefits, report that fact to the bureau at the request of the bureau or the commission at any time or at the request of the claimant or claimant's representative where the issue of compensation is pending in a workers' compensation hearing or adjudication matter indicating the dates of the payment of the first and last installments of compensation, and the total amount of each type paid, together with the total amounts expended for benefits other than compensation according to type of benefit.
(1) Such report shall be signed by the employer and the employee or his or her dependents or their legal representatives as the circumstances may require.
(2) Upon receipt of such report by the bureau, it shall be examined to determine whether or not the payments made have been in conformity with the provisions of the workers' compensation law. If it is found that the reported payments do conform to the provisions of the workers' compensation law, the same shall be approved by the bureau and the employer shall be advised thereof. If it is found that the reported payments do not conform, the bureau shall notify the employer of that fact indicating the further payment payments that are to be made. The employer shall make such payments and file a revised report with the bureau.
(3) If, for any reason, it is impossible for the employer to promptly file a report of payments or an agreement as to compensation paid or to be paid, the employer shall immediately report that fact and the reason therefor to the bureau. Failure to do so shall be sufficient reason for the administrator to take such action as may be indicated.
(E) Where compensation has been ordered paid or where the employee and employer have agreed upon the compensation to be paid, request to the bureau may be made by either the employer, the employee, or the employee's dependents for authorization to pay all or part of the unpaid balance of the award in one or more lump sum payments.
(F) Whenever a self-insured employer that is a professional sports franchise domiciled in Ohio makes payment pursuant to the terms of a contract of hire or a collective bargaining agreement during a period of disability resulting from the injury or occupational disease, the self-insurer shall report such payments on the same basis as required in paragraph (A) of this rule. The total amount of such payments, the period of disability for which those payments were made, and the amount such payments exceed the compensation that was due for that period shall be reported. The amount such payments exceed the compensation payable or, in the event no compensation was payable, the total amounts of such payments, shall be considered advanced payments and shall be applied to offset future payments of compensation for disability under sections 4123.56 to 4123.58 of the Revised Code. The self-insurer shall report these offsets on the same basis as required in paragraph (A) of this rule. Offsets shall be made only in cases where the employee's application for compensation is pending on or after August 22, 1986.

(A) Requests for subsequent actions when a state fund claim has not had activity or a request for further action within a period of time in excess of twenty-four months.
(1) The bureau shall consider a request for subsequent action in a claim in the following situations:
(a) Where the employee seeks to have the bureau or commission modify or alter an award of compensation or benefits that has been previously granted; or
(b) Where the employee seeks to have the bureau or commission grant a new award of compensation or to settle the claim; or
(c) Where the claimant seeks to secure the allowance of a disability or condition not previously considered; or
(d) Where the claimant dies and there is potential entitlement for accrued benefits or payment of medical bills, or the decedent's dependent is requesting death benefits due to relatedness between the recognized injury and death.
(e) Except for a medical issue relating to a prosthetic device or durable medical equipment as designated by the administrator, the bureau, in consultation with the MCO assigned to the claim, shall issue an order on a medical treatment reimbursement request in a claim which has not had activity or a request for further action within a period of time in excess of twenty-four months as follows:
(i) The MCO shall refer a medical treatment reimbursement request in a claim which has not had activity or a request for further action within a period of time in excess of twenty-four months to the bureau for an order when the request is accompanied by supporting medical evidence dated not more than sixty days prior to the date of the request, or when such evidence is subsequently provided to the MCO upon request (via "Form C-9A" or equivalent). The bureau's order shall address both the causal relationship between the original injury and the current incident precipitating the medical treatment reimbursement request in a claim and the necessity and appropriateness of the requested treatment. The employer or the employee or the representative may appeal the bureau's order to the industrial commission pursuant to section 4123.511 of the Revised Code.
(ii) The MCO may dismiss without prejudice, and without referral to the bureau for an order, a medical treatment reimbursement request in a claim which has not had activity or a request for further action within a period of time in excess of twenty-four months when the request is not accompanied by supporting medical evidence dated not more than sixty days prior to the date of the request and such evidence is not provided to the MCO upon request (via "Form C-9A" or equivalent).
(2) Requests which require proof shall conform to the standards required by paragraph (C) of rule 4123-3-09 of the Administrative Code and rules 4123-5-18 and 4123-6-20 of the Administrative Code.

(3) In state fund cases, upon request for subsequent action under paragraph (A)(1) of this rule, the bureau shall, upon notification, inform the parties to the claim of the pending action prior to issuing a decision. Upon request, the bureau shall provide a copy of the request and proof to the employer and the claimant, and their representatives, where applicable. Requests in self-insuring employers' cases shall be submitted to the self-insuring employer which shall accept or refuse the matters sought.
(4) The bureau or commission may require the filing of additional proof or legal citations by either party or may make such investigation or inquiry as the circumstances may require.
(5) A state fund employer shall, upon receipt of notification of the request, notify the bureau of any objection to the granting of the relief requested. Such notification must be filed within the time as required by the rules of the bureau and industrial commission.

If the request is within the jurisdiction of the bureau and the matter is not contested or disputed, the bureau shall adjudicate the request in the usual manner. In all other cases, the request shall be acted upon by the industrial commission's hearing officer or as otherwise required by the rules of the commission, depending on the subject matter.
(7) Failure by the employee to furnish information as specifically requested by the bureau or commission shall be considered sufficient reason for the dismissal of the request. If the employer fails to furnish any information requested by the bureau or commission, the request may be adjudicated upon the proof filed.
(B) "Application for Determination of Percentage of Permanent Partial Disability or Increase of Permanent Partial Disability" pursuant to division (A) of section 4123.57 of the Revised Code in state fund and self-insured claims.
(1) An "Application for Determination of Percentage of Permanent Partial Disability or Increase of Permanent Partial Disability" shall be completed and signed by the applicant or applicant's representative and shall be filed with the bureau of workers' compensation. An application for an increase in permanent partial disability must be accompanied by substantial evidence of new and changed circumstances which have developed since the time of the hearing on the original or last determination. Unsigned applications shall be dismissed by the bureau. Except where an additional condition has been allowed in the claim and the request is for an increase in permanent partial disability based solely on that additional condition, a request for an increase in permanent partial disability filed without medical documentation shall be dismissed by the bureau. Whenever the applicant or applicant's representative leaves a question or questions in the application form unanswered, the bureau shall contact the applicant and applicant's representative to obtain the information necessary to process the application. Should the applicant or applicant's representative inform the bureau that the failure to provide the information necessary to process the application is beyond the applicant's control, the bureau shall take appropriate action to obtain such information.
(2) Upon the filing of the application for either of these requests, the application shall be referred to the bureau for review and processing. The bureau shall send notice of the application to the employer and the employer's representative, unless the employer is out of business. The employer shall submit any proof within its possession bearing upon the issue to the bureau within thirty days of the receipt of the claimant's application.

The bureau shall send a copy of the report of the medical examination to the employee, the employer, and their representatives.
(4) Upon receipt of the examining physician's report, the bureau shall review the medical evidence in the employee's claim file and shall make a tentative order as the evidence at the time of the making of the order warrants. If the bureau determines that there is a conflict of evidence, the application, along with the claimant's file, shall be forwarded to the industrial commission to set the application for hearing before a district hearing officer.
(5) Where there is no conflict of evidence, the bureau shall enter a tentative order on the request for percentage of permanent partial disability and shall notify the employee, the employer, and their representatives, in writing, of the tentative order and of the parties' right to request a hearing. Unless the employee, the employer, or their representative notifies the bureau, in writing, of an objection to the tentative order within twenty days after receipt of the notice thereof, the tentative order shall go into effect and the employee shall receive the compensation provided in the order. In no event shall there be a reconsideration of a tentative order issued under this division.
(6) If the employee, the employer, or their representatives timely notify the bureau of an objection to the tentative order, the matter shall be referred to a district hearing officer who shall set the application for hearing in accordance with the rules of the industrial commission. Upon referral to a district hearing officer, the employer may obtain a medical examination of the employee, pursuant to the rules of the industrial commission.
(7) Where the application is for an increase in the percentage of permanent partial disability, no sooner than sixty days from the date of mailing of the application to the employer and the employer's representative, the applicant shall either be examined, or the claim referred for review by a physician designated by the bureau. Such period may be extended or the processing of the application suspended by the bureau for good cause shown. If the bureau has determined that the employer is out of business the application will not be mailed and the bureau may process the application without waiting the sixty day period. The bureau physician shall file a report of such examination or review of the record, together with an evaluation of the degree of impairment, as part of the claim file. Either the employee or the employer may submit additional medical evidence following the examination by the bureau medical section as long as copies of the evidence are submitted to all parties.
(8) After completion of the review or examination by a physician designated by the bureau, the bureau may issue a tentative order based upon the evidence in file. If the bureau determines that there is a conflict in the medical evidence, the bureau shall adopt the recommendation of the medical report of the bureau medical examination or medical review.
(9) The bureau shall enter a tentative order on the request for an increase of permanent partial disability and shall notify the employee, the employer, and their representatives, in writing, of the nature and amount of any tentative order issued on the application requesting an increase in the percentage of the employee's permanent disability. The employee, the employer, or their representatives may object to the tentative order within twenty days after the receipt of the notice thereof. If no timely objection is made, the tentative order shall go into effect. In no event shall there be a reconsideration of a tentative order issued under this division. If an objection is timely made, the matter shall be referred to a district hearing officer who shall set the application for a hearing in accordance with the rules of the industrial commission. The employer may obtain a medical examination of the employee and submit a defense medical report at any stage of the proceedings up to a hearing before a district officer.
(10) Where an award under division (A) of section 4123.57 of the Revised Code has been made prior to the death of an employee, all unpaid installments accrued or to accrue are payable to the surviving spouse, or if there is no surviving spouse, to the dependent children of the employee, and if there are no such children surviving, then to such other dependents as the bureau may determine.
(C) Payment of permanent partial disability pursuant to division (B) of section 4123.57 of the Revised Code (scheduled loss) in state fund and self-insured employer claims.
(1) The bureau or self-insuring employer will determine the payment of scheduled loss for a loss by amputation or for a loss of use upon the motion of a party for such award. To determine the payment of the award, the bureau or self-insuring employer may review the medical evidence in the file, may request additional medical information from the parties, or may refer the injured worker for an examination by a physician designated by the bureau or self-insuring employer.
(2) The bureau shall enter an order on or the self-insuring employer shall make a decision on the payment of scheduled loss for a loss by amputation or for a loss of use and shall notify the employee, the employer, and their representatives, in writing, of the order or decision. The parties have a right to appeal the order or contest the decision pursuant to section 4123.511 of the Revised Code.

===================================================================



 

4123-3-18 Appellate procedure.
(A) Administrative appeals.
(1) The right of an administrative appeal is limited to the claimant, the dependents of a deceased worker, the employer, and the administrator, where the administrator or the administrator's representative appeals on behalf of the state insurance fund and/or the surplus fund.
(2) The above named eligible appellants may appeal decisions of the district hearing officers, or staff hearing officers.
(3) Decisions of district hearing officers are appealable to the staff hearing officers. Decisions of the staff hearing officers are appealable to the industrial commission.
(4) Appeals shall be filed in accordance with rule 4121-3-18 of the Administrative Code.
(5) Appeal applications shall be signed by the party appealing or by authorized representative on behalf of such party. The same applies to the administrator when filing an appeal.
(6) Such applications may be filed with any office of the bureau or of the industrial commission.
(7) The same time limits apply to appeals filed from the decision of the staff hearing officers to the industrial commission.
(8) Appellate review and determination of claims being within the exclusive jurisdiction of the industrial commission, the conduct of hearings and other incidental matters are governed by the rules of the industrial commission.
(9) The bureau's legal division shall act as attorney in appeals filed by the bureau on behalf of the state insurance fund; it may also act as a representative of the administrator in appeals filed by the bureau on behalf of the surplus fund. As a party to the proceedings, the bureau's legal division shall be entitled to proper notice of any action taken by the appellate body on appeals filed by the bureau.
(10) The bureau shall make payment of an award of compensation in a claim at the earliest time provided in division (H) of section 4123.511 of the Revised Code, except that, in all cases of a determination made under division (A) of section 4123.57 of the Revised Code for percentage permanent partial disability compensation, no payment shall be made to the claimant until a final decision on reconsideration allows such compensation.
(11) In all other cases, if the decision of the district hearing officer is appealed by the employer or the administrator, the bureau shall withhold medical benefits during the course of appeal to the staff hearing officer, but where the staff hearing officer rules in favor of the claimant, medical benefits shall be paid by the bureau immediately upon the receipt of the order, regardless of whether or not further appeal is taken. In self-insuring employers' claims, payment shall be made in accordance with applicable laws and rules.
(12) Payments of an award of compensation and/or benefits made by the bureau pursuant to a decision of a staff hearing officer shall commence immediately upon the bureau's receipt of the order.
(B) Appeals to court.
(1) The claimant or the employer may appeal an order of the industrial commission made under division (E) of section 4123.511 of the Revised Code in any injury or occupational disease case, other than a decision as to the extent of disability to the court of common pleas of the county in which the injury was inflicted or in which the contract of employment was made if the injury occurred outside the state, or in which the contract of employment was made if the exposure occurred outside the state. If no common pleas court has jurisdiction for the purposes of an appeal by the use of the jurisdictional requirements described in this division, the appellant may use the venue provisions in the Rules of Civil Procedure to vest jurisdiction in a court. If the claim is for an occupational disease, the appeal shall be to the court of common pleas of the county in which the exposure which caused the disease occurred. Like appeal may be taken from an order of a staff hearing officer made under division (D) of section 4123.511 of the Revised Code from which the commission has refused to hear an appeal. The appellant shall file the notice of appeal with a court of common pleas within sixty days after the date of the receipt of the order appealed from or the date of receipt of the order of the commission refusing to hear an appeal of a staff hearing officer's decision under division (D) of section 4123.511 of the Revised Code. The filing of the notice of the appeal with the court is the only act required to perfect the appeal.
(2) "Notice of Appeal" stating the names of the claimant and the employer, the number of the claim, the date of the decision appealed from and the fact that the appellant appeals from such order must be filed with the industrial commission and with the court of common pleas within sixty days after the date of the receipt of the decision appealed from or the date of receipt of the order of the commission refusing to permit further appeal .
(3) Such appeal or any other action filed from a decision of the industrial commission in a claim in which an award of compensation has been made shall not stay the payment of compensation under such award or payment of compensation for subsequent periods of total disability during the pendency of the appeal.

===================================================================



 

4123-3-31 Disabled workers' relief fund: claimant's payments.
(A) On and after August 22, 1986, all persons, without regard to date of injury, who are receiving compensation for permanent and total disability which, when combined with disability benefits received pursuant to the Social Security Act, is less than three hundred forty-two dollars per month adjusted annually as provided in division (B) of section 4123.62 of the Revised Code, shall be eligible to participate in the disabled workers' relief fund. For purposes of this rule, this amount shall be referred to as the "DWRF qualifying figure."
(B) Each person who has satisfied the requirements of paragraph (A) of this rule shall receive from the disabled workers' relief fund a monthly amount equal to either the difference between the DWRF qualifying figure and such amount as the person is receiving per month as disability benefits from the social security administration or the difference between the DWRF qualifying figure and such amount as the person is receiving under the workers' compensation laws for permanent total disability, whichever calculation results in the lower DWRF payment. The following is an example of the computations to be performed pursuant to this rule.
$ 800.00 DWRF qualifying figure
- 400.00 permanent total disability benefits
$ 400.00
$ 800.00 DWRF qualifying figure
- 300.00 disability social security benefits
$ 500.00
$ 400.00 = DWRF payment
(C) For purposes of this rule, in the case of individuals who have received a commutation of permanent total disability benefits pursuant to the provisions of section 4123.64 of the Revised Code, payments from the disabled workers' relief fund shall be calculated as if such commutation had not been made.
(D) This rule shall only apply to DWRF payments for August 22, 1986, and thereafter, and shall have no effect on DWRF payments for any periods prior to August 22, 1986.

Upon reviewing a claim file where a waiver has not been received, the bureau may recommend to the employer that the examination be waived, and shall contact the employer by telephone or in writing to confirm the waiver of the examination, except where the bureau has determined the employer is out of business. The bureau may waive the examination even if the employer indicates that the examination should proceed where the bureau determines that an examination is not necessary. The bureau shall mail a copy of all waivers, whether received directly from the employer or initiated by the bureau, to the employee, employer, and their authorized representatives, except where the bureau has determined the employer is out of business.
(C) The bureau shall conduct ninety day examinations for employees of self-insuring employers upon the request of the self-insuring employer. A self-insuring employer may determine that a ninety day examination is not necessary, and in that instance may decide not to request such examination be conducted by the bureau. At the appropriate time thereafter, the self-insuring employer may request that the ninety day examination be conducted. The self-insuring employer shall pay for the ninety day examination, as well as all reasonable expenses associated with the ninety day examination.
(D) Medical examinations scheduled under this rule shall not operate to limit medical examinations provided for in other provisions of Chapter 4121. or Chapter 4123. of the Revised Code.

===================================================================



 

4123-3-34 Settlement of state fund claims.
(A) The procedures of this rule shall apply to the settlement of state fund injury and occupational disease claims.
(B) The employer or the claimant shall file an application for approval of settlement agreement on the appropriate form with the administrator of workers' compensation. Each application shall include the signature of the claimant and the employer, except as follows:
(1) A claimant may file an application without an employer's signature in the following situations:
(a) The employer is no longer doing business in Ohio;
(b) The claim no longer is in the employer's industrial accident or occupational disease experience as provided in division (B) of section 4123.34 of the Revised Code and the claimant no longer is employed with that employer; or,
(c) The employer has failed to comply with section 4123.35 of the Revised Code.
(2) If a claimant files an application without an employer's signature, and the employer still is doing business in this state, the bureau shall send written notice of the application to the employer immediately upon receipt of the application. If the employer fails to respond to the notice within thirty days after the notice is sent, the application need not contain the employer's signature.
(C) Each settlement application shall:
(1) Include a list of the claim numbers and body parts affected in all claims filed by the claimant with the administrator of workers' compensation or the industrial commission.
(2) Set forth the reason the proposed full and final settlement is deemed desirable by the claimant and state the amount of the requested settlement.
(D) Settlement may be requested for a portion of a claim, one or more claims, or a combination of claims, provided that the claimant is not required to enter into a settlement agreement for every claim that has been filed with the bureau by the claimant.
(E) The administrator shall utilize whatever methods the administrator determines to be appropriate, consistent with general insurance principles, to evaluate a claim for settlement. When a settlement agreement has been approved by the administrator, a notice of approval shall be sent to the claimant, the employer, and their representatives, informing them of their rights to withdraw consent to the settlement agreement within thirty days. If written notice of the withdrawal of consent is not filed within the thirty day period, the settlement agreement is final. An injured worker's refusal to endorse a settlement check issued as a result of an agreement reached pursuant to these procedures does not alter the finality of the settlement. The administrator may reopen a settled claim for purposes of conducting a fraud investigation.
(F) The administrator shall also send the notice of approval to the industrial commission within five days from the date of the bureau order of approval. The staff hearing officer shall determine, within the time set forth in paragraph (E) of this rule, whether the settlement agreement is or is not a gross miscarriage of justice. If the staff hearing officer determines within that time period that the settlement agreement is clearly unfair, the staff hearing officer shall issue an order disapproving the settlement agreement. If the staff hearing officer determines that the settlement agreement is not clearly unfair, or fails to act within the time limits, the settlement agreement is approved.
(G) The effective date of the settlement is the date the notice of approval of settlement agreement is mailed. Once the thirty day waiting period has passed as set forth in paragraphs (E) and (F) of this rule, the agreed settlement shall be final and cannot be appealed to the industrial commission or to court.
(H) When a settlement application is filed in a claim in which an application for violation of specific safety requirement has been granted or is pending, the administrator shall refer the claim to the industrial commission for disposition of the application for violation of the specific safety requirement. If the application for the specific safety requirement has been granted and the employer is no longer doing business, or is otherwise not making the payments required by any award for violation of any specific safety requirement, the administrator may approve a final settlement without referring the claim to the industrial commission, provided the administrator identifies any settlement amounts that may be attributed to the award for violation of specific safety requirement. The administrator need not refer to the industrial commission any claim in which the injured worker has voluntarily withdrawn an application for violation of a specific safety requirement, provided no portion of the settlement amount is attributed to any violation of a specific safety requirement.
(I) The administrator may offset settlement amounts due the claimant by overpayments owed by the claimant or, where the claimant is also an employer, unpaid premiums owed by a claimant, as the administrator determines appropriate.
(J) The representative's signature for either the claimant or the employer satisfies the requirements for paragraphs (B) and (C) of this rule.
(K) A settled claim may be used as a defense to a claim for the same or similar conditions. A self-insuring employer shall not settle disabled workers' relief fund liability in state fund claims without the administrator's approval.

(3) With respect to the handicap condition defined in division (A)(25) of section 4123.343 of the Revised Code, an employer is not eligible for handicap reimbursement in the same claim in which the employee participated in a rehabilitation program. The employee must suffer a subsequent compensable injury or occupational disease claim, and any reimbursement rights would be in the subsequent claim.
(B) Under division (B) of section 4123.343 of the Revised Code, the administrator specifies the following grounds upon which the administrator may charge claims costs to the statutory surplus fund.
(1) The administrator will consider handicap reimbursement relief under section 4123.343 of the Revised Code only in claims satisfying all of the following prerequisites:
(a) The claimant is a handicapped employee as defined in division (A) of section 4123.343 of the Revised Code and paragraph (A) of this rule.
(b) The employer has filed an application for handicapped reimbursement while the claim is within the employer's claim experience period, as referred to in division (B) of section 4123.34 of the Revised Code.
(i) For a claim involving a private state fund employer with a date of injury on or before December 31, 2009, the application shall be filed by June thirtieth of the year no more than six years from the year of the date of the injury or occupational disease.
(ii) For a claim involving a private state fund employer with a date of injury on or after January 1, 2010:
(a) If the date of injury is between January first and June thirtieth, the application shall be filed by June thirtieth of the year no more than six years from the year of the date of the injury or occupational disease.
(b) If the date of injury is between July first and December thirty-first, the application shall be filed by June thirtieth of the year no more than seven years from the year of the date of the injury or occupational disease.
(iii) For a claim involving a public employer taxing district employer with a date of injury on or before December 31, 2009, the application shall be filed by December thirty-first of the year no more than five years from the year of the date of the injury or occupational disease.
(iv) For a claim involving a public employer taxing district employer with a date of injury on or after January 1, 2010, the application shall be filed by December thirty-first of the year no more than six years from the year of the date of the injury or occupational disease.
(v) For a claim involving a private state fund employer or a public employer taxing district employer participating in a retrospective rating plan, the application shall be filed within the time provided in paragraphs (B)(1)(b)(i) to (B)(1)(b)(iv) of this rule, as applicable.
(c) The bureau has awarded compensation to the claimant for temporary total disability, disabilities described under division (B) of section 4123.57 of the Revised Code, permanent total disability, or death benefits, or the claimant has received wages from the employer in lieu of compensation.
(2) For an employer granted relief, all or such portion as the administrator determines of the amount that otherwise would be charged to the employer's experience will be deducted from each claim arising from injury or occupational disease to a handicapped employee for the purpose of premium or assessment adjustment, in accordance with the following principles and paragraphs (E), (F), and (G) of this rule:
(a) All amounts deducted from the experience of the employer will be charged to the statutory surplus fund.
(b) The bureau will calculate the amount of the cost of the claim to remain in the employer's experience by applying the complement of the handicap percentage to the reducible costs contained within the claim cost as limited by the maximum value of a claim chargeable to the employer's experience, as determined by the employer's credibility group under rule 4123-17-05.1 of the Administrative Code.
(c) The bureau will apply the handicap reimbursement in a claim to only the following claims awards and reserves:
(i) Temporary total disability;
(ii) Disabilities described under division (B) of section 4123.57 of the Revised Code;
(iii) Permanent total disability;
(iv) Death benefits;
(v) Medical payments; and
(vi) Claims reserves.
(d) If the actual cost of a claim exceeds the maximum value of the claim chargeable to a particular employer's experience, the ratio of the nonreducible costs of the claim to the total cost of the claim shall be maintained in the maximum value chargeable to the particular employer's experience, so that when the handicap percentage is applied, it will be applied only to that portion of the maximum value that is reducible in accordance with division (B) of section 4123.343 of the Revised Code.
(e) Any agreement between an employer and the claimant as to the merits of a claim or the amount of the charge to the statutory surplus fund shall forfeit any rights of the employer to any handicap reimbursement under this rule. This provision does not apply to the employer's certification of the claim.
(C) The administrator of workers' compensation may delegate the authority granted to the administrator under Chapters 4121. and 4123. of the Revised Code for determining the amount an employer may be reimbursed from the statutory surplus fund in connection with the employer's handicapped employees under this rule. The decision of the administrator's designee shall be the decision of the administrator.
(1) An employer which seeks a handicap reimbursement award must file a complete and timely application and attach copies of all relevant medical evidence which the employer believes the administrator should consider when determining the appropriate award.

(b) The administrator may deny an application not file within the employer's experience as provided in division (B) of section 4123.34 of the Revised Code and paragraph (B)(1)(b) of this rule.
(c) The administrator may dismiss an application which fails to meet the jurisdictional requirements of paragraphs (A) and (B) of this rule.
(d) The administrator may dismiss an application if the initial allowance of the claim is being contested before the bureau, industrial commission, or a court of competent jurisdiction at the time the application is filed. Upon a final administrative or judicial determination allowing the claim, the employer may refile an application dismissed under this provision.
(2) The administrator may issue a handicap reimbursement order based on a review of the application and any information contained in any relevant claim file or any other relevant bureau or industrial commission records.
(3) The administrator shall afford an employer the opportunity for an informal conference if the application meets the jurisdictional requirements of this rule.
(a) If the administrator conducts an informal conference, the administrator shall mail a notice of conference to the employer and its representative by regular mail, setting forth the date, time, and place of the conference.
(b) The administrator shall notify the employer by mail not less than fourteen days before the date of such conference, unless the employer waives this requirement.
(c) At the request of the employer or another party, the administrator may conduct an expedited or an informal telephone conference.
(4) The administrator's decision shall be reduced to writing and mailed to all interested parties. The order shall state the evidence upon which the administrator based the decision.
(5) The administrator shall keep a record of handicap applications received, conferences scheduled, orders issued with publication dates and any waiver of appeals, and appeals to the industrial commission.
(D) The burden of proof is upon the employer to establish entitlement to the relief under section 4123.343 of the Revised Code by appropriate medical evidence or other evidence as may be indicated
(1) With respect to any credit under division (D)(1) of section 4123.343 of the Revised Code, the administrator shall grant full handicap credit if the employer establishes that the injury or occupational disease would not have occurred but for the employee's pre-existing handicap condition.
(2) With respect to any credit under division (D)(2) of section 4123.343 of the Revised Code, the administrator shall determine the degree of relief to be granted based upon the following:
(a) The degree to which medical evidence or other evidence indicates the pre-existing handicap has affected the cost of the claim.
(b) The employer shall establish the relationship between the pre-existing condition and subsequent injury by way of aggravation or delayed recovery by proof on file but the condition need not be recognized by an order of allowance for such condition or aggravation of the condition.
(c) In determining the appropriate per cent of relief in the claim, the administrator shall consider the effect of the handicap condition on the past claims costs and shall also account for the effect of the handicap condition on the anticipated future costs of the claim.
(E) A non-complying employer shall not be entitled to relief under section 4123.343 of the Revised Code. If the employer had active coverage on the date of the injury but was a non-complying employer on the date of the application for handicap reimbursement relief, the administrator may dismiss the application.
(F) No employer shall in any rating year receive credit under section 4123.343 of the Revised Code in an amount greater than the premium it paid .

(2) Upon waiver of the employer's right to an appeal or the expiration of the appeal period, the administrator's order is final, and the bureau will immediately process the award.
(3) If no agreement is reached at the informal conference and the employer files a written appeal within fourteen days of the employer's receipt of the administrator's decision, the administrator shall forward the claim file to the industrial commission within seven days of the administrator's receipt of the notice of appeal for a hearing before a district hearing officer.
(4) The employer and the administrator are parties at any hearing conducted by the industrial commission or its hearing officers.
(5) Upon a final industrial commission order which grants handicap relief, the bureau will immediately process the award.
(H) Since pursuant to paragraph (D)(2)(c) of this rule the administrator shall consider the effect of the handicap condition on the past and future costs of the claim in determining the handicap relief, the employer is not entitled to consideration of a subsequent application for handicap relief for a condition in a claim in which the administrator has made a previous determination on the condition, regardless of whether there has been a change in circumstances such as allowance of the condition or payment of compensation. A subsequent application shall not substitute for an appeal of the administrator's order. The administrator shall dismiss or deny any subsequent application for an increase in handicap relief in a previously determined claim.

===================================================================



 

4123-5-20 Payment of compensation when advancements are made during period of disability.
(A) Except for payments made to claimants under a contract of hire or under a collective bargaining agreement by an employer that is a professional sports franchise domiciled in Ohio, whenever a claimant and the employer advise the bureau in writing that wages or sick leave were paid or advancements were made solely for the purpose of assisting the claimant in obtaining necessary maintenance and care during a period not to exceed twelve weeks following an injury sustained or occupational disease contracted by the claimant in the course of and arising out of employment, particularly while a claim for compensation is being acted upon by the bureau, and the claimant and employer had mutually agreed that the employer is to be reimbursed, at least to the extent of any compensation paid to the claimant over the same period in which the wages were paid or the advancements made, the bureau shall issue warrants in payment of compensation awarded for a period not to exceed twelve weeks commencing from the date of such an injury or beginning of disability, which warrants are to be mailed to the claimant in care of the employer with instructions that the warrants are to be endorsed personally by the claimant. The bureau will not honor the agreement unless the written notice of the agreement is signed by the employer and claimant and filed with the bureau within thirty days of the beginning date of payment of wages, sick leave, or advancement. Failure to comply otherwise with the terms of this rule may result in the bureau's refusal to honor the terms of the agreement between the employer and the claimant. Within thirty days of the end date of payment of wages, sick leave, or advancement, the employer or claimant shall provide written notice to the bureau. The warrants to be sent in care of the employer are not to be in payment of compensation for disability in excess of a period of twelve weeks closely following the date of injury or beginning of disability, unless under special circumstances the bureau authorizes the sending of warrants in payment of compensation for disability beyond the twelve weeks in care of the employer.
(B) Whenever an employer that is a professional sports franchise domiciled in Ohio makes payment pursuant to the terms of a contract of hire or a collective bargaining agreement during a period of disability resulting from the injury or occupational disease, the aggregate amount of such payments shall be deemed an advanced payment. Upon the filing of proof of such payments, compensation payments under sections 4123.56 to 4123.58 of the Revised Code shall be reimbursed by the bureau directly to the employer if it is a state fund employer unless payment has been made to the claimant prior to the bureau's receipt of the employer's proof of an advanced payment. Self-insured employers shall apply the aggregate amount of advanced payments to a claimant to offset that claimant's future payments of compensation under section 4123.56 to 4123.58 of the Revised Code. Employer reimbursements and offsets shall apply only where the employee's application for compensation is pending on or after August 22, 1986.
(C) Where a claimant is entitled to vacation with pay, payment of wages for a vacation period during the period of temporary disability resulting from injury or occupational disease shall not be deemed an advancement nor shall such payment be applied to offset any temporary total compensation that is payable for that period of time.
Where claimants are paid a regular salary during the period of disability on any other basis, for example, sick leave, payment of compensation for temporary disability cannot be paid so long as such regular salary or wages are paid, unless the claimant and the employer notify the bureau in writing pursuant to paragraph (A) of this rule.

===================================================================



 

4123-6-06.2 Employee access to the HPP - employee choice of provider.
(A) HPP.
(1) Except as provided in paragraph (A)(2) of this rule, an injured employee may seek medical care for an industrial injury from:
(a) A bureau certified provider; or
(b) A non-bureau certified provider, subject to an employee's payment responsibilities as delineated below.
(2) Except in cases of emergency, an injured employee may not seek medical care for an industrial injury from himself, herself, or an immediate family member. An injured employee may not select as physician of record, himself, herself, or an immediate family member. The MCO, bureau, employer, and industrial commission shall not reimburse treatment to an injured employee delivered, rendered or directly supervised by the injured employee or an immediate family member. "Immediate family member" shall have the same meaning as in paragraph (A)(3)(b) of rule 4123-6-02.51 of the Administrative Code.
(3) At the time of an injury, the employee may seek medical care directly from a provider or may seek assistance from the MCO in selecting a provider. If the employee has not already sought medical care or selected a provider, the MCO may refer the employee to a provider or list of providers. The employee may, but is not required to, seek medical care from the referred provider or providers. The MCO shall not discriminate against any category of health care provider when referring the employee to a provider.
(4) If the employee seeks medical assistance from a provider, the employee shall inform the provider of the employee's MCO and/or employer. The provider shall then report the industrial injury in accordance with rule 4123-6-02.8 of the Administrative Code.
(a) If the provider is a non-bureau certified provider, the MCO shall inform the provider that the care for the first visit will be compensated by the MCO if the claim and the treated conditions are subsequently allowed and that, unless otherwise permitted by paragraph (A)(5)(a) or (A)(5)(b) of this rule, no further treatment will be authorized.
(b) If the provider is a non-bureau certified provider, the provider shall inform the employee upon the initial or emergency treatment that the provider is not a participant in the HPP and that payment will not be made by the bureau, MCO, or employer for the cost of further treatment after the initial or emergency treatment
(5) An injured employee may continue treatment with a non-bureau certified provider under two circumstances:
(a) The MCO has determined that the treatment to be provided by the non-bureau certified provider is not reasonably available through a like bureau certified provider and has authorized the non-bureau certified provider to continue to provide the treatment, or
(b) The employee may continue to treat with the non-bureau certified provider, but at the employee's own expense without recourse against the bureau, MCO, or employer.
(6) Notwithstanding any other provision of this rule, if the employee's date of injury is prior to October 20, 1993 and the employee's physician of record is a non-bureau certified provider, the employee may continue treatment with that non-bureau certified provider. The employer's MCO shall manage the medical care and treatment and return to work services in the claim and shall manage medical payment for the provider. However, if the employee changes the physician of record for any reason, the employee shall select a bureau certified provider as physician of record. If the employee selects a physician of record who is a non-bureau certified provider, payment for the provider shall be governed by the provisions of this rule applicable to non-bureau certified providers.
(B) QHP.
(1) An employee of an employer that participates in a QHP has freedom of choice of providers within the QHP network of providers established by the employer's QHP. If the employee's date of injury is prior to the establishment of the employer's QHP, and the employee's physician of record is not a provider on the panel of the QHP when established, the employee may continue treatment with that physician of record. The physician of record shall be subject to and participate in the dispute resolution process as provided in rule 4123-6-69 of the Administrative Code. After the establishment of the QHP, the employer's QHP shall manage the medical care and treatment in the claim. If an injured worker changes from the physician of record who is not in the QHP for any reason, the employee shall select a QHP panel provider as the physician of record.
(2) An employee of an employer that participates in a QHP, who is dissatisfied with the health care services of a provider in the QHP, after written notice to the QHP, may request a change of providers and may select another provider within the QHP, or any bureau certified provider. An employee's request for change of provider does not require notification to the bureau, but shall contain the reasons for the request. The QHP shall approve written requests for a change of provider within the QHP, or to any bureau certified provider, within seven days of receipt
(3) Notwithstanding the provisions contained in paragraph (B)(2) of this rule, an employee who incurs a new medical condition, injury or claim requiring medical treatment, not related to a prior medical condition, injury or claim, shall first seek treatment from a provider on the panel of the injured worker's employer's QHP.
(4) Medical management of all injured workers' claims, whether medical services are provided within or without the QHP network of providers, shall be provided by the employer's QHP.
(5) A provider certified to participate in the HPP shall be eligible to participate in and to treat injured workers under the QHP system.
(C) Self-insuring employer (non-QHP).
(1) In claims with a date of injury on or after November 2, 1959, employees of self-insuring employers have free choice to select licensed physicians for treatment, as well as other medical services, including, but not limited to, hospital and nursing services. In claims with a date of injury prior to November 2, 1959, medical services furnished by the self-insuring employer must be utilized
(2) Emergency treatment shall not constitute an exercise of free choice of physician.
(3) Once an employee of a self-insuring employer goes to a physician for treatment other than on an emergency basis, the employee is deemed to have made a choice of physician and the employee shall notify the employer of a change of physician.
(a) Change of physician requests shall be made to the self-insuring employer in writing, and shall include the name and address of the new physician and the proposed treatment.
(b) Self-insuring employers shall approve written requests for a change of physician within seven days of receipt.

(7) An employer or QHP shall pay a non-bureau certified hospital that provides initial or emergency medical treatment or further medical treatment that has been specifically authorized by the QHP the applicable amount under rule 4123-6-37.1 (inpatient) or 4123-6-37.2 (outpatient) of the Administrative Code, unless an alternate payment arrangement is negotiated between an employer or QHP and the provider in accordance with rule 4123-6-46 of the Administrative Code.
(8) The employer or QHP shall not pay for missed appointments or procedures. If the provider customarily charges for missed appointments or procedures, the provider shall inform the employee upon the initial or emergency treatment that the provider charges for missed appointments or procedures and that such charges are the responsibility of the employee.

(2) The self-insuring employer shall not pay for missed appointments or procedures. If the provider customarily charges for missed appointments or procedures, the provider shall inform the employee upon the initial or emergency treatment that the provider charges for missed appointments or procedures and that such charges are the responsibility of the employee.

===================================================================



 

4123-6-16 Alternative dispute resolution for HPP medical issues.
(A) Pursuant to division (A)(1) of section 4121.441 of the Revised Code, this rule shall provide procedures for an alternative dispute resolution (ADR) process for medical disputes between an employer, an employee, or a provider and an MCO arising from the MCO's decision regarding a medical treatment reimbursement request (on form C-9 or equivalent). An employee or employer must exhaust the ADR procedures of this rule prior to filing an appeal under section 4123.511 of the Revised Code on an MCO's decision regarding a medical treatment reimbursement request.
(B) Within fourteen days of receipt of an MCO decision , an employee, employer, or provider may dispute the decision in writing (on form C-11 or equivalent) to the MCO. The written medical dispute must contain, at a minimum, the following elements:
(1) Injured worker name.
(2) Injured worker claim number.
(3) Date of initial medical treatment reimbursement request in dispute.
(4) Specific issue(s) in dispute, including description, frequency/duration, beginning/ending dates, and type of treatment/service/body part.
(5) Name of party making written appeal request.
(6) Signature of party making written appeal request or the party's authorized representative.
Written medical disputes that do not contain the minimum elements set forth in this paragraph may be dismissed by the MCO or bureau.
(C) Upon receipt of a written medical dispute, the MCO shall initiate the ADR process. The MCO's ADR process shall consist of one independent level of professional review as follows:
(1) If an individual health care provider eligible to be physician of record would be providing the services requested in the dispute, the independent level of professional review shall consist of a peer review conducted by an individual or individuals licensed pursuant to the same section of the Revised Code as the health care provider who would be providing the services requested.
(2) Notwithstanding paragraph (C)(1) of this rule, if the MCO has already obtained one or more peer reviews during previous disputes involving the same or similar treatment, the MCO may obtain a different perspective review from a licensed physician who falls outside the peer review criteria set forth above.
(3) If an individual health care provider not eligible to be physician of record would be providing the services requested in the dispute, the independent level of professional review shall consist of a provider review conducted by an individual or individuals eligible to be physician of record whose scope of practice includes the services requested.
(4) If the MCO receives a dispute where the requested treatment appears to be the same as or similar to a previous treatment request for which the MCO conducted a professional review, and the previous treatment request was ultimately denied based on the professional review, the MCO may use the previous professional review to satisfy the independent level of professional review requirement of this paragraph.
(5) The MCO shall submit a copy of the professional review to the bureau, and the bureau shall provide the parties to the claim access to the professional review electronically.
(D) If, upon consideration of additional evidence or after agreement with the party that submitted the written medical dispute, the MCO reverses the decision under dispute or otherwise resolves the dispute to the satisfaction of the party, the MCO may issue a new decision and dismiss the dispute.
(E) Unless the MCO reverses the decision under dispute pursuant to paragraph (D) of this rule, the MCO shall complete the ADR process and submit its recommended ADR decision to the bureau electronically within twenty-one days of the MCO's receipt of the written medical dispute. The MCO may recommend that the employee be scheduled for an independent medical examination. This recommendation shall toll the MCO's time frame for completing the ADR process, and in such cases the MCO shall submit its recommended ADR decision to the bureau electronically within seven days after receipt of the independent medical examination report.
(F) Within two business days after receipt of a recommended ADR decision from the MCO, the bureau shall publish a final order. This order shall be mailed to all parties and may be appealed to the industrial commission pursuant to section 4123.511 of the Revised Code. The provider and the MCO may not file an appeal of the bureau order.
(G) Notwithstanding paragraph (C) of this rule, the MCO may pend a written medical dispute under the following circumstances:
(1) If the MCO receives a written medical dispute involving a medical treatment reimbursement request that appears to be the same as or similar to a previous treatment request for which the MCO conducted a provider review, and the previous treatment request is pending before the bureau or industrial commission, the MCO may pend the new dispute until the previous treatment request has been resolved. Once the previous treatment request has been resolved, the MCO shall resume the ADR process, and may proceed in accordance with paragraph (C)(4) of this rule if appropriate.
(2) If the MCO receives a written medical dispute involving a medical treatment reimbursement request relating to the delivery of medical services for a condition that is not allowed in the claim, and the issue of the allowance of the additional condition is pending before the bureau or industrial commission, the MCO may pend the dispute until the earlier of the final administrative or judicial decision or the industrial commission staff hearing officer decision on the allowance of the additional condition, at which time the MCO shall resume the ADR process.
(H) Notwithstanding paragraph (C) of this rule, an MCO may submit its recommended ADR decision to the bureau electronically without obtaining an independent level of professional review under the following circumstances:
(1) The MCO receives a written medical dispute involving a medical treatment reimbursement request relating to the delivery of medical services that have been approved by the MCO pursuant to standard treatment guidelines, pathways, or presumptive authorization guidelines.
(2) The MCO receives a written medical dispute involving a medical treatment reimbursement request relating to the delivery of medical services for a condition that is not allowed in the claim, and the issue of the allowance of the additional condition is not pending before the bureau or industrial commission.

4123-6-16.2 Medical treatment reimbursement requests.
(A) Medical treatment reimbursement requests (on form C-9 or equivalent) must be submitted by a provider eligible to submit such requests to the MCO responsible for medical management of the claim prior to initiating any non-emergency treatment.
The following provider types are eligible to submit medical treatment reimbursement requests to the MCO:
(1) A physician as defined in rule 4123-6-01 of the Administrative Code ;

(c) Physical therapists;
(d) Occupational therapists;
(e) Optometrists;

(1) The requested services are reasonably related to the industrial injury (allowed conditions);
(2) The requested services are reasonably necessary for treatment of the industrial injury (allowed conditions);
(3) The costs of the services are medically reasonable.
(C) For informational purposes, the bureau may require the provider to include on the medical treatment reimbursement request the applicable codes, from the edition of the centers for medicare and medicaid services' healthcare common procedure coding system (HCPCS) in effect on the date of the request, for the procedures or services being requested.
However, review of the request shall be directed to the treatment being requested, and shall not be construed as approving or denying payment for the specific codes listed by the provider.
(D) Medical treatment reimbursement requests in inactive claims shall be processed in accordance with the provisions of rule 4123-3-15 of the Administrative Code.
(E) Medical treatment reimbursement requests submitted by a physical therapist or occupational therapist must be accompanied by a prescription as required in paragraph (B) of rule 4123-6-30 of the Administrative Code, and approval of such requests shall be valid for no longer than thirty days unless the approval specifies a longer period and such longer period is supported by the prescription. Approval of all medical treatment reimbursement requests shall be valid for no longer than six months unless the approval specifies a longer period.
(F) The MCO may dismiss without prejudice medical treatment reimbursement requests under the following circumstances:
(1) The request has been submitted by a provider who is not enrolled with the bureau and who refuses to become enrolled, or who is enrolled but non-certified and is ineligible for payment as a non-certified provider under rule 4123-6-06.2 or 4123-6-10 of the Administrative Code or division (N) of section 4121.44 of the Revised Code.
(2) The request is not accompanied by supporting medical documentation that the submitting provider has examined the injured worker within thirty days prior to the request, or that the injured worker requested a visit with the provider, and such evidence is not provided to the MCO upon request ( through form C-9A or equivalent).
(3) The request duplicates a previous request that has been denied in a final administrative or judicial determination where the new request is not accompanied by supporting medical documentation of new and changed circumstances impacting treatment, and such evidence is not provided to the MCO upon request ( through form C-9A or equivalent).
(4) The underlying claim has been settled, and the dates of service requested are on or after the effective date of the settlement. If the request includes both dates of service on or after the effective date of the settlement and dates of services prior to the effective date of the settlement, the MCO may dismiss without prejudice only that portion of the request relating to dates of service on or after the effective date of the settlement.
(5) The underlying claim has been disallowed or dismissed in its entirety, or the only allowances in the underlying claim are for substantial aggravation of a pre-existing condition, and the conditions have been determined in a final administrative or judicial determination to be in a non-payable status.
(6) The services or supplies being requested are never covered by the bureau pursuant to other bureau statutes or rules.
(7) The MCO has requested from the submitting provider ( through form C-9A or equivalent) supporting medical documentation necessary to the MCO's evaluation and determination, and such documentation is not provided to the MCO.
(G) If the MCO determines that any approved medical treatment reimbursement request is not medically indicated or necessary, is not producing the desired outcomes, or the injured worker is not responding, the MCO may notify the parties of its decision to discontinue payment of approved treatment that has not already been rendered.
This decision shall be subject to alternative dispute resolution pursuant to rule 4123-6-16 of the Administrative Code.

===================================================================



 

4123-6-21 Payment for outpatient medication.
(A) Except as otherwise provided in rule 4123-6-21.6 of the Administrative Code, medication must be for the treatment of an occupational injury or disease in a claim either allowed by an order of the bureau or the industrial commission, or recognized by a self-insuring employer. The bureau may deny a drug or therapeutic class of drugs as not being reasonably related to or medically necessary for treatment of the allowed conditions in a claim.
(B) Medication may be prescribed by any treating provider authorized by law to prescribe such medication; however, reimbursement for medication shall be denied under the following circumstances:

(3) Compounded non-sterile prescriptions.
(a) Reimbursement for non-sterile compounded prescriptions shall only be considered for preparations that contain not less than one nor more than three active pharmaceutical ingredients that have been issued a national drug code (NDC) number by the FDA, and that contain only one prescription drug from any specific therapeutic class of drugs (as defined in the edition of the "American Hospital Formulary Service Drug Information" in effect on the billed date(s) of service).
(b) Reimbursement for non-sterile compounded prescriptions shall only be considered upon the submission of both:
(i) A prior authorization request, and
(ii) A copy of the signed prescription that lists all active pharmaceutical ingredients and indicates the usual and customary cost of the prescription. The prescription must comply with the Ohio state board of pharmacy requirements for a valid prescription set forth in rules 4729-5-13 and 4729-5-30 of the Administrative Code.
(c) Approval for reimbursement of non-sterile compounded prescriptions will be for an initial period of ninety days with subsequent approvals contingent upon clinical documentation of improvement in both pain and function. Not more than one prescription for a non-sterile compounded prescription will be approved for reimbursement in any thirty day period.
(d) The bureau may approve reimbursement for a non-sterile compounded prescription for topical use only after the injured worker has been prescribed and has tried for at least thirty days, and the bureau has reimbursed, a commercially available topical prescription or over-the-counter product with documentation that the intended therapeutic benefit was not achieved or an unacceptable adverse event or allergic reaction occurred.

The bureau shall not reimburse any third-party pharmacy biller that submits pharmacy bills on behalf of a pharmacy provider or that has purchased pharmacy bills from a pharmacy provider for subsequent submission to the bureau for payment. Pharmacy providers are required to submit for billing the NDC number of the stock bottle from which the dispensed medication is obtained. Drugs may be dispensed in unit dose packaging, but the NDC number of the closest comparable bulk package listed in the bureau or the bureau's pharmacy benefit manager's payment system must be used for billing purposes. The pharmacy provider shall:
(1) Maintain a signature log verifying receipt by the injured worker of applicable covered medications;
(2) Include prescriber information within bills submitted electronically to the bureau or the bureau's pharmacy benefits manager for payment. The prescriber information must include the national provider identifier (NPI) or the drug enforcement administration (DEA) number;
(3) Not pay, allow, or give, or offer to pay, allow, or give, any consideration, money, or other thing of value to an injured worker (including but not limited to free or discounted medications or other goods or services) as an inducement to or in return for the injured worker ordering or receiving from the provider any medications or other goods or services for which payment may be made by the bureau, the bureau's pharmacy benefits manager, or MCO under Chapter 4121., 4123., 4127., or 4131. of the Revised Code;
(4) Comply with all applicable billing instructions contained in the bureau's provider billing and reimbursement manual in effect on the billed date(s) of service.
(I) The bureau may establish a maximum allowable cost for single source or multi-source medications which are pharmaceutically and therapeutically equivalent, that is, contain identical doses of the active ingredient and have the same biological effects as determined by the FDA and designated by an "A" code value in the FDA publication, "Approved Drug Products With Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations" in effect on the billed date(s) of service. The methodology used to determine a maximum allowable cost for a qualified drug product shall be determined by the bureau. For multi-source drugs, the bureau may choose to utilize the maximum allowable cost list of a vendor or develop its own maximum allowable cost list. For single source drugs, the maximum allowable cost shall be the drug's AWP price minus fifteen per cent.
(J) Claimants who request a brand name drug or whose physician specifies a brand name drug designated by "dispense as written" on the prescription for a medication for which single source or multi-source medications exist that are pharmaceutically and therapeutically equivalent, as defined in paragraph (I) of this rule, shall be liable for the product cost difference between the established maximum allowable cost price of the drug product and the AWP of the dispensed brand name drug minus fifteen percent. However, the bureau may approve reimbursement of the dispensed brand name drug at the AWP of the drug minus fifteen per cent if the following circumstances are met:
(1) The injured worker has a documented, systemic allergic reaction which is consistent with known symptoms or clinical findings of a medication allergy; and
(2) The injured worker has been prescribed, and has tried, other A code drugs in the therapeutic class and the intended therapeutic benefit has not been achieved or an unacceptable adverse event has occurred.
(K) The following dispensing limitations may be adopted by the bureau:
(1) The bureau may publish supply limitations for drugs which represent the maximum number of days supply that may be dispensed at any one time for a single prescription.
(2) The bureau may publish maximum prescription quantities which represent the largest number of units per drug that may be dispensed at any one time for a single prescription.
(3) Requests submitted that exceed any published days supply limit or maximum quantity limit shall be denied. Denials may be overridden by the bureau in cases where medical necessity and appropriateness have been determined.
(4) Refills requested before seventy-five per cent of any published days supply limit has been utilized will be denied, except in cases where the dosage of a drug has been changed and has a new prescription number. Denials may be overridden by the bureau for the following documented reasons:
(a) Pharmacist entered previous wrong day supply;
(b) Out of country vacation or travel;
(c) Pharmacy will be closed for more than two days.
(d) An emergency or disaster, as defined in division (O) of section 4123.511 of the Revised Code, is declared by the governor of Ohio or the president of the United States.
(L) Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (F) of this rule, outpatient medications shall be billed to and reimbursed through the bureau's pharmacy benefits manager. Pharmacy providers must submit bills for medication by an on-line point-of-service authorization terminal or a host-to-host link with the bureau's pharmacy benefits manager's established bill processing system as a condition of provider enrollment or reimbursement. Submission by paper or by tape-to-tape will not be accepted by the bureau or the bureau's pharmacy benefits manager.
(M) Claimant reimbursement for medications shall be in accordance with rule 4123-6-26 of the Administrative Code. Claimant requests for reimbursement shall comply with all applicable billing instructions contained in the bureau's provider billing and reimbursement manual in effect on the billed date(s) of service. Claimant reimbursement may be limited to the following situations:
(1) Claimants whose medication is not payable under division (I) of section 4123.511 of the Revised Code on the date of service, but later becomes payable;
(2) Emergency situations where an enrolled pharmacy provider with point-of-service capabilities is not available;
(3) Claimants who reside out of the country.
(N) The bureau may formulate medication utilization protocols for select conditions or diseases consistent with current medical texts and peer reviewed medical literature.
Compliance with the established protocols shall be monitored through the on-line, point-of-service adjudication system. Refusal to comply with the established protocols shall result in refusal of reimbursement for the medications which are not within the established protocols. This rule does not require the discontinuation of treatment with medications that are not within the established protocols, but simply states the bureau's refusal to reimburse for such medications.
(O) A "pharmacy provider" designation and provider number can be obtained by a provider who meets all the following criteria:
(1) Has a valid "terminal distributor of dangerous drugs" as defined in section 4729.01 of the Revised Code if located within Ohio; or an equivalent state license if located outside of Ohio; and,
(2) Has a valid DEA number; and,
(3) Has a licensed registered pharmacist in full and actual charge of a pharmacy; and,
(4) Has the ability and agrees to submit bills at the point of service.
All state and federal laws and regulations relating to the practice of pharmacy and the dispensing of medication by a duly licensed pharmacist must be observed.
(P) The bureau may contract with a pharmacy benefit manager to perform drug utilization review and on-line bill processing, maintain a pharmacy provider network and prior authorization program for medications, and provide management reports. The bureau or its vendor may also contract rebate agreements with drug manufacturers. The bureau may utilize other services or established procedures of the pharmacy benefits manager which may enable the bureau to control costs and utilization and detect fraud.
(Q) The bureau may identify circumstances under which it may consider reimbursement for pharmacist professional services (also known as cognitive services) when payment for such services results in a measurable, positive outcome. The bureau shall be responsible for developing the criteria which will be used to assess the compensability of billed pharmacist professional services. The bureau shall be responsible for developing the structure of the reporting of the measurable outcomes used to justify the payment of pharmacist professional services, which may include reimbursement for the dispensing fee component. The amount that could be reimbursed for pharmacist professional services shall be determined by the bureau.
(R) The bureau shall retain a registered pharmacist licensed in the state of Ohio to act as the full-time pharmacy program director to assist the bureau in the review of drug bills. The pharmacy program director may assist the bureau in determining the appropriateness, eligibility, and reasonableness of compensation payments for drug services. The bureau may adopt a drug formulary with the recommendation of the bureau's pharmacy and therapeutics committee established by rule 4123-6-21.2 of the Administrative Code, and may consult with the committee on the development and ongoing annual review of the drug formulary and other issues regarding medications.

Exceptions to the single dispensing fee are:
(i) Cases where the physician has prescribed a second round of medication within the twenty-five day period;
(ii) Cases where the physician has changed the dosage;
(iii) Cases where the medication did not last for the intended days supply;
(iv) Cases where the self-insuring employer determines the limitations of this paragraph to be unnecessary under the specific circumstances.
(3) The dispensing fee component for non-sterile compounded prescriptions shall be eighteen dollars and seventy-five cents.
(4) The dispensing fee component for sterile compounded prescriptions shall be thirty-seven dollars and fifty cents.
(F) The pharmacy provider is required to bill medication at their usual and customary charge. The amount paid to the provider will be the lesser of the provider's usual and customary charge or the reimbursement allowed as determined in paragraph (E) of this rule, unless the self-insuring employer has negotiated a payment rate with the provider pursuant to rule 4123-6-46 of the Administrative Code. Pharmacy providers are required to submit for billing the national drug code (NDC) number of the stock bottle from which the dispensed medication is obtained. Drugs may be dispensed in unit dose packaging, but the NDC number of the closest comparable bulk package listed in the bureau or vendor payment system must be used for billing purposes.
(G) The pharmacy provider shall:
(1) Maintain a signature log verifying receipt of applicable covered medications;
(2) Include prescriber information within bills submitted electronically to the self-insuring employer or its vendor for payment. The prescriber information must include the national provider identifier (NPI) or the drug enforcement administration (DEA) number;
(3) Not pay, allow, or give, or offer to pay, allow, or give, any consideration, money, or other thing of value to an injured worker (including but not limited to free or discounted medications or other goods or services) as an inducement to or in return for the injured worker ordering or receiving from the provider any medications or other goods or services for which payment may be made by the self-insuring employer or its vendor or QHP under Chapter 4121., 4123., 4127., or 4131. of the Revised Code;
(4) Comply with all applicable billing instructions contained in the bureau's provider billing and reimbursement manual in effect on the billed date(s) of service.
(H) Claimant reimbursement for medications shall be in accordance with rule 4123-6-26 of the Administrative Code and shall at least be equal to the bureau's established rate for the medication, unless the self-insuring employer has negotiated a payment rate with the pharmacy provider utilized by the claimant pursuant to rule 4123-6-46 of the Administrative Code, in which case the claimant reimbursement shall be at least the rate negotiated with the provider. Claimant requests for reimbursement shall comply with all applicable billing instructions contained in the bureau's provider billing and reimbursement manual in effect on the billed date(s) of service. Requests for reimbursement must be paid within thirty days of receipt of the request.
(I) Self-insuring employers must obtain a drug utilization review from a physician before terminating payment for current medications, as follows:
(1) Before terminating payment for current medications, the self-insuring employer shall notify all parties to the claim (including authorized representatives) and the prescribing physician, in writing, that a physician drug review is being performed, or has been performed, regarding the necessity and appropriateness of the continued use of current medications (by therapeutic drug class).
(2) The written notice shall inform all parties to the claim (including authorized representatives) and the prescribing physician that they have twenty-one days from receipt of the notice to provide additional information and/or medical documentation to justify the need for continued use of the medications (by therapeutic drug class).
(3) The self-insuring employer shall provide all medically related information regarding the medications to an independent physician reviewer for review and opinion as to the necessity or appropriateness of the medications. If the self-insuring employer has obtained an independent physician reviewer's report prior to sending the notice required by paragraph (I)(1) of this rule and subsequently receives additional information and/or medical documentation pursuant to paragraph (I)(2) of this rule, the self-insuring employer shall provide the additional information and/or medical documentation to the independent physician reviewer and obtain an addendum. The independent physician reviewer's report (and addendum, if applicable) shall address the medical rationale, necessity and appropriateness of the drug treatment in the control of symptoms associated with the allowed conditions in the claim.
(4) When the independent physician reviewer's report (and addendum, if applicable) indicates the drug treatment is not medically necessary or appropriate for treatment or in the control of symptoms associated with the allowed conditions in the claim, the self-insuring employer may terminate reimbursement for the medications (by therapeutic drug class) effective as of the date of receipt of the independent physician reviewer's report, or addendum if one is obtained, or in the case that a drug is in a therapeutic class that requires a "weaning-off" period, such other date as agreed to by the prescribing physician and self-insuring employer.
(5) In the event the self-insuring employer terminates reimbursement for the medications as set forth in paragraph (I)(4) of this rule, the self-insuring employer or its authorized representative shall provide all parties to the claim (including authorized representatives) and the prescribing physician with a copy of the independent physician reviewer's report (and addendum, if applicable) and the self-insuring employer shall notify the employee and the employee's representative in writing of its decision to terminate. The employer's notification to the employee and employee's representative shall indicate that the employee has the right to request a hearing before the industrial commission.
(6) In the event there is a dispute as to whether the drug treatment is medically necessary or appropriate for treatment of the symptoms associated with the allowed conditions in the claim, the disputed matter shall be adjudicated in accordance with paragraph (K)(5) of rule 4123-19-03 of the Administrative Code.
(J) Self-insuring employers may deny initial requests for a drug or therapeutic class of drugs as not being reasonably related to or medically necessary for the treatment of the allowed conditions in a claim.
(K) Self-insuring employers may utilize medication utilization protocols formulated by the bureau for select conditions or diseases consistent with current medical texts and peer reviewed medical literature.
Refusal to comply with the established protocols shall result in refusal of reimbursement for the medications which are not within the established protocols. This rule does not require the discontinuation of treatment with medications that are not within the established protocols, but simply states the bureau's or self-insured employer's refusal to reimburse for such medications.
(L) Through internal development or through vendor contracts, self-insuring employers may implement a point-of-service adjudication system. Upon implementation, a self-insuring employer may require pharmacy providers to submit bills for medication by an on-line point-of-service authorization terminal or a host-to-host link with the established bill processing system as a condition of reimbursement, and may refuse submission by paper or by tape-to-tape. Self-insuring employers utilizing a point-of-service adjudication system may refuse to reimburse any third-party pharmacy biller that submits pharmacy bills on behalf of a pharmacy provider or that has purchased pharmacy bills from a pharmacy provider for subsequent submission to the self-insuring employer for payment.
(M) Self-insuring employers utilizing a point of service adjudication system may require prior authorization of drugs or therapeutic classes of drugs which appear on the bureau's published list of drugs or therapeutic classes of drugs for which prior authorization is required.
(N) Self-insuring employers utilizing a point-of-service adjudication system may apply the following dispensing limitations, adopted by the bureau, to medications approved and reimbursed by the self-insuring employer:
(1) The bureau may publish maximum prescription quantities which represent the largest number of units per drug that may be dispensed at any one time for a single prescription.
(2) Requests submitted that exceed either the days supply limit or maximum quantity limit shall be denied; provided, however, that the pharmacy provider may still fill the prescription up to the days supply limit or maximum quantity limit, as applicable. Denials may be overridden by the self-insured employer in cases where medical necessity and appropriateness have been determined.
(3) Refills requested before seventy-five per cent of the days supply has been utilized will be denied, except in cases where the dosage of a drug has been changed and has a new prescription number. Denials may be overridden by the self-insured employer for the following documented reasons:
(a) Pharmacist entered previous wrong day supply;
(b) Out of country vacation or travel;
(c) Pharmacy will be closed for more than two days.
(d) An emergency or disaster, as defined in division (O) of section 4123.511 of the Revised Code, is declared by the governor of Ohio or the president of the United States.
(O) Self-insuring employers utilizing a point-of-service adjudication system may apply the maximum allowable cost list of the point-of-service adjudication system vendor for multi-source medications which are pharmaceutically and therapeutically equivalent, that is, contain identical doses of the active ingredient and have the same biological effects as determined by the FDA and designated by an "A" code value in the FDA publication, "Approved Drug Products With Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations" in effect on the billed date(s) of service. For single source drugs, self-insuring employers utilizing a point-of-service adjudication system may utilize as a maximum allowable cost the drug's AWP minus fifteen per cent.
(P) Claimants who request a brand name drug or whose physician specifies a brand name drug designated by "dispense as written" on the prescription for a medication for which single source or multi-source medications exist that are pharmaceutically and therapeutically equivalent, as defined in paragraph (O) of this rule, shall be liable for the product cost difference between the established maximum allowable cost price of the drug product and the AWP of the dispensed brand name drug minus fifteen per cent. However, the self-insuring employer or its vendor may approve reimbursement of the dispensed brand name drug at the AWP of the drug minus fifteen per cent if the following circumstances are met:
(1) The injured worker has a documented, systemic allergic reaction which is consistent with known symptoms or clinical findings of a medication allergy; and
(2) The injured worker has been prescribed, and has tried, other A code drugs in the therapeutic class and the intended therapeutic benefit has not been achieved or an unacceptable adverse event has occurred.
(Q) A self-insuring employer has sufficient grounds to refuse to pay for the dispensing of drugs and other medications when a pharmacy provider fails to observe any state or federal law relating to his or her professional licensure or to the dispensing of drugs and other medication.

===================================================================



 

4123-6-21.4 Coordinated services program.
The bureau, or a self-insuring employer with a point-of-service adjudication system, may establish a coordinated services program (CSP) that requires an injured worker to obtain prescription medications reimbursed by the bureau or self-insuring employer from a single designated pharmacy and/or prescriber.
(A) Placement in a CSP.
(1) The bureau or self-insuring employer with a point-of-service adjudication system may review an injured worker for possible placement in a CSP if a review of his or her claim indicates the injured worker meets one or more of the following criteria:
(a) Use of three or more different prescribers to obtain prescriptions of the same or comparable medications per three month time frame;
(b) Receipt of prescription drugs from more than two different pharmacies per three month time frame;
(c) Monthly receipt of three or more prescriptions including refills for drugs identified by therapeutic drug class as a narcotic analgesic per three month time frame;
(d) Monthly receipt of more than two concurrent narcotic analgesics in the same therapeutic drug class per three month time frame;
(e) Monthly receipt of more than two narcotic analgesics in the same therapeutic drug class, more than one benzodiazepine, and more than one sedative-hypnotics per three month time frame.
(2) Upon identification of an injured worker meeting one or more of the criteria identified in paragraphs (A)(1)(a) to (A)(1)(e) of this rule, the bureau or self-insuring employer with a point-of-service adjudication system shall obtain a physician review of the injured worker's most recent twelve months history of prescription medications reimbursed by the bureau or self-insuring employer.
(3) If, based on this physician review, the bureau or self-insuring employer with a point-of-service adjudication system determines that the injured worker's utilization of prescription medications during this period was at a frequency or in an amount that was not medically necessary or appropriate under the criteria set forth in paragraphs (B)(1) to (B)(3) of rule 4123-6-16.2 of the Administrative Code, or was potentially unsafe, the bureau or self-insuring employer may place the injured worker in a CSP.
(4) Notwithstanding paragraphs (A)(1) to (A)(3) of this rule, if the bureau or self-insuring employer with a point-of-service adjudication system determines that an injured worker has been convicted of or pled guilty to an offense under Chapter 2925. of the Revised Code or any other criminal offense related to the misuse of drugs, the bureau or self-insuring employer may place the injured worker in a CSP.
(5) Placement in a CSP shall be for an initial period of eighteen months. The bureau or self-insuring employer with a point-of-service adjudication system may place the injured worker in the CSP for additional eighteen month periods in accordance with paragraph (A)(6) of this rule.
(6) The bureau or self-insuring employer with a point-of-service adjudication system may evaluate an injured worker's medication utilization at the conclusion of each eighteen month period in the CSP. If the bureau or self-insuring employer determines that the injured worker's medication utilization continues to meet the criteria set forth in paragraphs (A)(1) to (A)(4) of this rule, the bureau or self-insuring employer may place the injured worker in the CSP for an additional eighteen month period.
(7) If an injured worker placed in the CSP enters a nursing home, residential care/assisted living facility, or hospice program, the injured worker shall be released from the CSP. If the injured worker is subsequently discharged from the nursing home, residential care/assisted living facility, or hospice program during the CSP period, the bureau or self-insuring employer with a point-of-service adjudication system may place the injured worker back into the CSP.
(B) Selection of designated pharmacy and/or prescriber.
(1) An injured worker placed into a CSP pursuant to paragraph (A)(3) or (A)(4) of this rule shall be given the opportunity to select a designated pharmacy from a list of participating pharmacies maintained by the bureau or self-insuring employer. If an injured worker fails to select a designated pharmacy, or selects a designated pharmacy that is unable or unwilling to accept the injured worker, the bureau or self-insuring employer may select a designated pharmacy for the injured worker.
(2) An injured worker placed in a CSP pursuant to paragraph (A)(3) or (A)(4) of this rule may only change from one designated pharmacy to another in the following circumstances:
(a) The designated pharmacy becomes inaccessible to the injured worker due to relocation or incapacity of the injured worker or closing of the designated pharmacy,
(b) The designated pharmacy chooses to no longer participate in the CSP or to provide services to the injured worker in accordance with paragraph (D)(4) of this rule.
(c) The injured worker requests to be assigned to another designated pharmacy due to personal preference. Not more than one change due to personal preference shall be approved in a rolling twelve-month period.
(3) An injured worker placed in the CSP pursuant to paragraph (A)(4) of this rule shall be given the opportunity to select a designated prescriber from among those bureau certified providers who meet the definition of physician under paragraph (D) of rule 4123-6-01 of the Administrative Code. If an injured worker fails to select a designated prescriber, or selects a designated prescriber that is unable or unwilling to accept the injured worker, the bureau or self-insuring employer may select a designated prescriber for the injured worker.
(4) An injured worker placed in a CSP pursuant to paragraph (A)(4) of this rule may only change from one designated prescriber to another in the following circumstances:
(a) The designated prescriber becomes inaccessible to the injured worker due to relocation or incapacity of the injured worker or closing of the designated prescriber's practice,
(b) The designated prescriber chooses to no longer provide services to the injured worker,

(a) In cases of emergency as defined in paragraph (O) of rule 4123-6-01 of the Administrative Code;
(b) With prior authorization, prescriptions written by a specialist in cases where the injured worker has been referred to a specialist for care.
(D) Pharmacies participating in the bureau's CSP.
(1) The bureau shall maintain a list of pharmacies participating in the bureau's CSP that are eligible for selection by an injured worker as a designated pharmacy. To participate in the bureau's CSP, a pharmacy must meet the following criteria:

(b) The pharmacy shall notify the injured worker's prescribing physician of any critical findings discovered in the report. Critical findings are indications of any prescription related activity that could cause harm to the patient, including but not limited to:
(i) Duplication of therapy,
(ii) Excessive doses of concurrent medications,
(iii) Potential drug interactions or potentiation of side effects.
(c) The pharmacy shall notify BWC in writing whenever reports are made under paragraph (D)(2)(b) of this rule.

Pharmacies participating in the bureau's CSP may discontinue providing services to an individual injured worker at any time upon not less than thirty days written notice to the bureau, the injured worker, and the injured worker's authorized representative.
(5) The bureau may terminate the CSP agreement of a pharmacy participating in the bureau's CSP in accordance with the terms of the CSP agreement.
(E) Pharmacies participating in a self-insuring employer's CSP.
(1) A self-insuring employer with a point-of-service adjudication system who establishes a CSP shall maintain a list of pharmacies participating in the self-insuring employer's CSP that are eligible for selection by an injured worker as a designated pharmacy. The list of participating pharmacies shall cover a geographic area sufficient to provide the self-insuring employer's injured workers with reasonable access to pharmacy providers.
(2) Pharmacies participating in a self-insuring employer's CSP shall provide not less than thirty days written notice to an injured worker and the injured worker's authorized representative prior to discontinuing services to the injured worker.
(F) Disputes.
(1) Decisions by the bureau regarding an injured worker's placement in the bureau's CSP, assignment of a designated pharmacy or designated prescriber, or denial of an injured worker's request for change of designated pharmacy or designated prescriber may be appealed to the industrial commission in accordance with section 4123.511 of the Revised Code.
(2) Decisions by a self-insuring employer regarding an injured worker's placement in the self-insuring employer's CSP, assignment of a designated pharmacy or designated prescriber, or denial of an injured worker's request for change of designated pharmacy or designated prescriber shall indicate that the injured worker has the right to request a hearing before the industrial commission.

--->ohio--->Ohio Rules--->Chapter 4123: Bureau of Workers' Compensation--->Chapter 4123-6 Health Partnership Program--->4123-6-21.7 Utilization of opioids in the subacute or chronic phases of pain treatment for a work-related injury or occupational disease.
===================================================================



 

4123-6-21.7 Utilization of opioids in the subacute or chronic phases of pain treatment for a work-related injury or occupational disease.
(A) Definitions.
For purposes of this rule:
(1) "Chronic phase of pain treatment" means that an injured worker is considered to be experiencing chronic pain or pain that has persisted after reasonable medical efforts have been made to relieve the pain or cure its cause and that has continued, either continuously or episodically, for longer than twelve continuous weeks after the date of injury or occupational disease, or after a surgical intervention related to the allowed conditions of the claim.
(2) "Clinically meaningful improvement in pain and function" or "CMIF" means a measured and meaningful improvement in the ability of the injured worker to engage in activities of daily living, or to make progress toward accomplishing any daily activity goals established at the onset of treatment with emphasis on a possible return to work.
(3) "Clinically validated and appropriate drug testing methodology" means a chemical analysis of a specimen (e.g. urine, blood, saliva, hair) to identify presence or absence of parent drugs or their metabolites. For purposes of this rule, it is inclusive of both the immunoassay and a confirmation test such as gas chromatography, mass spectrometry or high-performance liquid chromatography.
(4) "Informed consent" has the same meaning as defined in rule 4731-29-01 of the Administrative Code.
(5) "Morphine equivalent dose" or "MED" means the equivalent daily amount of morphine represented by all of the opioids prescribed for an injured worker as measured by the conversion factors used by the Ohio board of pharmacy at the time the opioids are prescribed. This metric is used to approximate the total opioid load of an individual injured worker.
(6) "OARRS" means the "Ohio Automated Rx Reporting System" drug database established and maintained pursuant to section 4729.75 of the Revised Code.
(7) "Opioid" has the same meaning as "opiate" as defined in division (R) of section 3719.01 of the Revised Code.
(8) "Subacute phase of pain treatment" means that an injured worker is experiencing pain that has persisted after reasonable medical efforts have been made to relieve it and has continued, either continuously or episodically, for longer than six continuous weeks but less than twelve continuous weeks after the date of injury or occupational disease, or after a surgical intervention related to the allowed conditions of the claim.
(B) Current clinical literature has shown that long term utilization of opioids in workers' compensation claims is associated with an increased length of time until an injured worker returns to work. Therefore, it is highly recommended that prescribers consider and apply appropriate Ohio opioid prescribing guidelines prior to initially prescribing opioids to treat an injured worker, and continuously throughout the injured worker's course of opioid therapy.
This rule governs the bureau's reimbursement of opioid prescriptions used to treat a work related injury or occupational disease in the subacute phase of pain treatment, at high doses, or in the chronic phase of pain treatment, and for discontinuing opioids in the chronic phase of pain treatment. It is not meant to preclude, or substitute for, the prescriber's responsibility to exercise sound clinical judgment in light of current best medical practices and appropriate Ohio opioid prescribing guidelines when treating injured workers.
(C) Effective October 1, 2016 for claims with a date of injury on or after September 1, 2016 and for all claims on or after January 1, 2017, reimbursement for opioid prescriptions used to treat a work related injury or occupational disease shall be limited to claims in which current best medical practices as implemented by Ohio state medical board rule 4731-21-02 of the Administrative Code and this rule are followed.
The bureau shall not reimburse for any further prescriptions for opioids, and prescribers should discontinue prescribing opioids, if the applicable criteria of Ohio state medical board rule 4731-21-02 of the Administrative Code and this rule are not met. A prescriber's failure to comply with the requirements of these rules may constitute endangerment to the health and safety of injured workers, and claims involving opioid prescribing not in compliance with these rules may be subject to peer review by the bureau of workers' compensation pharmacy and therapeutics (P&T) committee pursuant to rule 4123-6-21.2 of the Administrative Code, the bureau of workers' compensation stakeholders' health care quality assurance advisory committee (HCQAAC) pursuant to rule 4123-6-22 of the Administrative Code, or other peer review committee established by the bureau.
(D) Opioid utilization in the subacute phase of pain treatment.
(1) Reimbursement for opioid prescriptions for an injured worker during the subacute phase of pain treatment shall only be provided in claims where a prescriber has documented the following actions prior to either escalating the dosing regimen beyond fifty milligrams morphine equivalent dose (MED) per day, or prescribing opioids more than six weeks after the injured worker's date of injury or occupational disease or surgery related to allowed conditions in the claim, whichever occurs first:
(a) Development of an individualized treatment plan that is justified with clinical rationale.
(b) Establishment of a risk assessment through the use of a clinically validated tool for screening and assessment, the OARRS prescription reporting system, and a clinically validated and appropriate drug testing methodology.
(c) Documented response to treatment as demonstrated by CMIF in the injured worker.
(2) Because continuous utilization of opioid medications in the chronic phase of pain treatment is associated with substantial risk for harm, opioid prescribing or dose increases that do not result in CMIF are considered not medically necessary or appropriate in the Ohio workers' compensation system.
(E) Opioid utilization at high doses or in the chronic phase of pain treatment.
(1) Reimbursement for opioid prescriptions for an injured worker at doses greater than eighty milligrams MED per day or in the chronic phase of pain treatment shall only be provided in claims where a prescriber has documented the following actions prior to either escalating the dosing regimen beyond eighty milligram MED per day, or prescribing opioids more than twelve weeks after the injured worker's date of injury or occupational disease or surgery related to allowed conditions in the claim, whichever occurs first:
(a) Verification that the requirements of paragraphs (D)(1)(a) to (D)(1)(c) of this rule have been met.
(b) Documentation that reasonable alternatives to opioids have been tried and failed.
(2) Reimbursement for opioid prescriptions for an injured worker at doses greater than one hundred twenty milligrams MED per day or in the chronic phase of pain treatment shall only be provided in claims where a prescriber has documented the following actions prior to either escalating the dosing regimen beyond one hundred twenty milligrams MED per day, or prescribing opioids more than twelve weeks after the injured worker's date of injury or occupational disease or surgery related to allowed conditions in the claim, whichever occurs first:
(a) Verification that the requirements of paragraphs (D)(1)(a) through (D)(1)(c) and paragraphs (E)(1) (a) and (E)(1)(b) of this rule have been met.
(b) Documentation of a risk benefit assessment of the injured worker to determine whether to continue opioid prescribing or to initiate weaning.
(c) Consultation with a pain management specialist if the injured worker's dose is above one hundred twenty milligrams MED per day and there is no demonstrated CMIF or special circumstance such as the need for compassionate care as defined in paragraph (G) of this rule.
(d) Evidence of the injured worker's informed consent and provision to the injured worker of written education materials regarding opioid analgesics.
(e) Appropriate additional consultations if the injured worker has a co-morbid substance use issue or poorly controlled mental health disorder.
(F) Discontinuing opioids in the chronic phase of pain treatment.
(1) Reimbursement for treatments required to assist an injured worker during the discontinuance of opioid prescriptions in the chronic phase of pain treatment shall only be provided in claims where the treatment record reflects the following actions more than twelve weeks after the injured worker's date of injury or occupational disease or surgery related to allowed conditions in the claim:
(a) Documentation in the medical record of an intent to discontinue opioid treatment of the injured worker in a timeframe consistent with the standard dose tapering schedules set forth in the appendix to rule 4123-6-21.5 of the Administrative Code in effect at the time the intent to discontinue opioid treatment of the injured worker is documented.
(b) Documentation in the medical record of a clear plan for tapering the injured worker's total opioid load as measured by daily MED.
(c) Monthly documentation of adherence with the plan.
(2) During the eighteen months subsequent to the date of the documented plan to discontinue opioid treatment, the bureau will reimburse appropriate and medically necessary formulary medications pursuant to an approved prior authorization request that documents use of such medications as adjuncts to withdrawal of opioid medications. During this eighteen month period, the bureau will also reimburse appropriate and medically necessary inpatient treatment for detoxification for up to thirty days and outpatient treatment for opioid use disorder, according to the version of patient placement criteria of the American society of addiction medicine (ASAM) in effect during this eighteen month period. Reimbursement is contingent on documentation of the following:
(a) Documentation of concurrence with the plan of treatment by the injured worker's physician of record or treating physician.
(b) All medications prescribed for treatment of pain and opioid withdrawal during this eighteen month period must be prescribed by a single designated prescriber selected by the injured worker. Any change in prescriber during this period must be approved by the administrator.
(c) Documentation of compliance by the injured worker as indicated by monthly OARRS reports and at least bi-monthly use of a clinically validated and appropriate drug testing method. Evidence of more than two events of non-compliance by the injured worker shall be cause for the bureau to cease reimbursement for all clinical interventions directed at treating opioid withdrawal.
(G) Compassionate care.
The administrator may grant an exemption to the requirements listed in paragraph (E) of this rule at the recommendation of either the bureau's chief medical officer or the P&T, HCQAAC, or other peer review committee established by the bureau, following review of the claim, if the injured worker's injuries or treatment history is such that strict application of this rule would offer no improvement in the injured worker's overall health, safety, or quality of life, or continuing care of the injured worker will require a prolonged course of surgeries or multiple surgical interventions.

--->ohio--->Ohio Rules--->Chapter 4123: Bureau of Workers' Compensation--->Chapter 4123-6 Health Partnership Program--->4123-6-23 Jurisdictional principles applicable to payment of bills for medical services rendered by health care providers.
===================================================================



 

4123-6-23 Jurisdictional principles applicable to payment of bills for medical services rendered by health care providers.
Jurisdictional requirements for payment for medical services rendered by a health care provider are as follows:
(A) Bills must be filed within the time provided in rule 4123-3-23 of the Administrative Code.
(B) In claims where the date of injury is on or after December 11, 1967, and prior to August 25, 2006, there is no jurisdiction to consider payment for medical services, if six years or more have elapsed since the date of the last payment of a medical bill and no compensation has been paid, except as provided in the following cases:
(1) A bill filed within the six-year period for services rendered within the period can be paid after the six-year period when, except for the time passage, it would have been paid.
(2) When an application requesting the payment of medical bills and/or compensation is filed within the six-year period, there is justification to act on the application after the period.
(a) Bills for services rendered within the six-year period can be ordered paid and can be paid after the period. However, these bills must be filed no later than two years after the date that services were rendered.
(b) Compensation can be ordered paid provided that evidence in the claim supports an award. If compensation is paid, the claim is opened for an additional ten years for the payment of compensation and bills. When there has been a payment of compensation under section 4123.56, 4123.57, or 4123.58 of the Revised Code, the claim is active for ten years from either the date of the last payment of compensation, or ten years from the last payment of a medical bill, whichever is later.
(3) Payment for medical services can be made when the claimant has received wages paid by the employer, instead of compensation for total disability. Medical services may be reimbursed when wages have been paid within six years of the date of injury with the employer's knowledge that an allowed claim exists.
(4) When a request for authorization of treatment beyond the six-year period is filed within the six-year period, the authorization for treatment after that period cannot be granted, unless the claim has been opened by the payment of compensation.
(5) There is no jurisdiction to consider the merits of any application filed after the six-year period, even though supporting evidence for the application was on file within the period.
(6) A bill filed within the six-year period that requires reactivation of the claim cannot be paid when an application for reactivation is not filed within the period. This rule also applies to bills filed after the expiration of the six-year period for treatment rendered within that period.
(C) In claims where the date of injury is prior to December 11, 1967, there is no jurisdiction to consider payment for medical services if ten years or more have elapsed since the payment of compensation or benefits, or, when no compensation has been awarded, ten years have elapsed since the date of injury.
(D) In claims where the date of injury is on or after August 25, 2006, there is no jurisdiction to consider payment for medical services if five years or more have elapsed since the payment of compensation or benefits. The provisions of paragraph (B) of this rule shall apply to the payment of medical bills in claims where the date of injury is on or after August 25, 2006, except that where those provisions reference six year and ten year time limits, the time limits shall be five years.

===================================================================



 

4123-6-25 Payment for medical supplies and services.
(A) Medical or other services to be approved for payment must be rendered as a direct result of an injury sustained or occupational disease contracted by a claimant in the course of and arising out of employment. The claim must be allowed by an order of either the bureau of workers' compensation or the industrial commission, or have been recognized by a self-insuring employer.
Medical supplies and services will be considered for payment when they are medically necessary for the diagnosis and treatment of conditions allowed in the claim, are causally related to the conditions allowed in the claim, and are rendered by a health care provider. Payment for services rendered to a claimant shall be paid to a health care provider only when the provider has either delivered, rendered or supervised the examination, treatment, evaluation or any other medically necessary and related services . Provider supervision of services shall comply with the requirements of the provider's regulatory board and the centers for medicare and medicaid services (CMS), if applicable, for supervision of the service, as in effect on the billed date of service, unless otherwise specified in the bureau's provider billing and reimbursement manual in effect on the billed date of service. By submitting any fee bill to the bureau, in either hardcopy or electronic format, the health care provider affirms that medical supplies and services have been provided to the claimant as required by this rule.
Providers billing for services rendered shall follow the procedures set forth in the bureau's provider billing and reimbursement manual in effect on the billed date of service.
(B) Services rendered by health care providers are subject to review for coding requirements outlined in paragraph (C) of this rule. Payments to health care providers may be adjusted based upon these guidelines.
(C) Coding systems.
(1) Billing codes.
(a) Practitioners are required to use the edition of the centers for medicare and medicaid services' healthcare common procedure coding system (HCPCS) in effect on the billed date of service to indicate the procedure or service rendered to injured workers.
(b) Inpatient and outpatient hospital services must be billed using the national uniform billing committee's revenue center codes in effect on the billed date of service (date of discharge for inpatient services).
(c) Outpatient medication services must be billed pursuant to the requirements described in the bureau's provider billing and reimbursement manual in effect on the billed date of service.
(d) To insure accurate data collection, the bureau shall adopt a standardized coding structure which shall be adopted by any MCO, QHP, or self-insuring employer.
(2) Diagnosis codes.
Providers must use the appropriate "International Classification of Diseases, clinical modification" codes for the condition(s) treated to indicate diagnoses.
(D) Prior to services being delivered, the provider must make reasonable effort to notify the claimant, bureau, MCO, QHP or self-insuring employer when the provider has knowledge that the services may not be related to the claimed or allowed condition(s) related to the industrial injury or illness, or that a service is non-covered. The provider may not knowingly bill or seek payment from the bureau, MCO, QHP or self-insured employer for services that are not related to the claimed or allowed condition(s) related to the industrial injury or illness. The provider may not knowingly mislead or direct providers of ancillary services to bill or seek payment for services that are not related to the claimed or allowed condition.
The provider may not bill or seek payment from the claimant for services determined as medically unnecessary through the use of bona fide peer review based on accepted treatment guidelines.

4123-6-37.1 Payment of hospital inpatient services.
(A) HPP.
Unless an MCO has negotiated a different payment rate with a hospital pursuant to rule 4123-6-10 of the Administrative Code, reimbursement for hospital inpatient services with a discharge date of February 1, 2017, or after shall be as follows:
(1)
(a) Reimbursement for hospital inpatient services, other than outliers as defined in paragraph (A)(3) of this rule or services provided by hospitals subject to reimbursement under paragraph (A)(4) of this rule, shall be calculated using the applicable medicare severity diagnosis related group (MS-DRG) reimbursement rate for the hospital inpatient service under the medicare inpatient prospective payment system, multiplied by a payment adjustment factor of 1.127, according to the following formula:
MS-DRG reimbursement rate x 1.127 = bureau reimbursement for hospital inpatient service.
(b) In the event the centers for medicare and medicaid services makes subsequent adjustments to the medicare reimbursement rates under the medicare inpatient prospective payment system as implemented by the materials specified in paragraph (A)(7) of this rule other than technical corrections, including but not limited to adjustments related to federal budget sequestration pursuant to the Budget Control Act of 2011, 125 Stat. 239, 2 U.S.C. 900 to 907d as amended as of the effective date of this rule, the "applicable medicare severity diagnosis related group (MS-DRG) reimbursement rate for the hospital inpatient service under the medicare inpatient prospective payment system" as specified in this paragraph shall be determined by the bureau without regard to such subsequent adjustments.
(2) In addition to the payment specified by paragraph (A)(1) of this rule, hospitals operating approved graduate medical education programs and receiving additional reimbursement from medicare for costs associated with these programs shall receive an additional per diem amount for direct graduate medical education costs associated with hospital inpatient services reimbursed by the bureau. Hospital specific per diem rates for direct graduate medical education shall be calculated annually by the bureau effective February first of each year, using the most current cost report data available from the centers for medicare and medicaid services, according to the following formula:
1.127 x [(total approved amount for resident cost + total approved amount for allied health cost)/ total inpatient days] = direct graduate medical education per diem.
Direct graduate medical education per diems shall not be applied to outliers as defined in paragraph (A)(3) of this rule or services provided by hospitals subject to reimbursement under paragraph (A)(4) of this rule.
(3)
(a) Reimbursement for outliers as determined by medicare's inpatient prospective payment system outlier methodology shall be calculated using the applicable medicare severity diagnosis related group (MS-DRG) outlier reimbursement rate for the hospital inpatient service under the medicare inpatient prospective payment system multiplied by a payment adjustment factor of 1.754, according to the following formula:
MS-DRG outlier reimbursement rate x 1.754 = bureau reimbursement for hospital inpatient service outlier.
(b) In the event the centers for medicare and medicaid services makes subsequent adjustments to the medicare reimbursement rates under the medicare inpatient prospective payment system as implemented by the materials specified in paragraph (A)(7) of this rule other than technical corrections, including but not limited to adjustments related to federal budget sequestration pursuant to the Budget Control Act of 2011, 125 Stat. 239, 2 U.S.C. 900 to 907d as amended as of the effective date of this rule, the "applicable medicare severity diagnosis related group (MS-DRG) outlier reimbursement rate for the hospital inpatient service under the medicare inpatient prospective payment system" as specified in this paragraph shall be determined by the bureau without regard to such subsequent adjustments.
(4) Reimbursement for inpatient services provided by hospitals and distinct-part units of hospitals designated by the medicare program as exempt from the medicare inpatient prospective payment system shall be determined as follows:
(a) For hospitals the department of health and human services, centers for medicare and medicaid services maintained hospital-specific cost-to-charge ratio information on as of October 1, 2016, based on the hospitals' submitted cost report ( CMS-2552-10), reimbursement shall be equal to the hospital's allowable billed charges multiplied by the hospital's reported operating cost-to-charge ratio (from the inpatient provider specific file in use by medicare on October 1, 2016) multiplied by a payment adjustment factor of 1.14, not to exceed seventy per cent of the hospital's allowed billed charges.
(b) For hospitals the department of health and human services, centers for medicare and medicaid services did not maintain hospital-specific cost-to-charge ratio information on as of October 1, 2016, reimbursement shall be equal to the hospital's allowable billed charges multiplied by the applicable fiscal year 2017 urban or rural statewide average operating cost-to-charge ratio set forth in table 8A of the federal rule referenced in paragraph (A)(5)(b) of this rule (the Ohio average operating cost-to-charge ratio shall be used for hospitals outside the United States) multiplied by a payment adjustment factor of 1.14, not to exceed seventy per cent of the hospital's allowed billed charges.
(5) Reimbursement for inpatient services provided by hospitals and distinct-part units of hospitals that do not participate in the medicare program shall be calculated using the national standardized amount for fiscal year 2017, full update, as found at 81Fed. Reg. 57312 ( 2016).
(6) Reimbursement for inpatient services provided by "new hospitals" as defined in 42 C.F.R. 412.300(b) as published in the October 1, 2016 Code of Federal Regulations shall be calculated in the same manner as provided under paragraph (A)(4)(b) of this rule.
(7) For purposes of this rule, the "applicable medicare severity diagnosis related group (MS-DRG) reimbursement rate" or "value" shall be determined in accordance with the medicare program established under Title XVIII of the Social Security Act, 79 Stat. 286 (1965), 42 U.S.C. 1395 to 1395-lll as amended as of the effective date of this rule, excluding 42 U.S.C. 1395ww(m), as implemented by the following materials, which are incorporated by reference:
(a) 42 C.F.R. Part 412 as published in the October 1, 2016 Code of Federal Regulations;
(b) Department of health and human services, centers for medicare and medicaid services' "42 CFR Parts 405, 412, 413, et.al. medicare program; hospital inpatient prospective payment systems for acute care hospitals and the long-term care hospital prospective payment system and policy changes and fiscal year 2017 rates; quality reporting requirements for specific providers graduate medical education; hospital notification procedures applicable to beneficiaries receiving observation services; technical changes relating to costs to organizations and medicare cost reports; finalization of interim final rules with comment period on LTCH PPS payments for severe wounds, modifications of limitations on redesignation by the medicare geographic classification review board, and extensions of payments to MDHs and low-volume hospitals; final rule," 81 Fed.

4123-6-41 No legal relationship between the industrial commission or bureau and a health care provider.
(A) Direct payment to a health care provider or other person by the industrial commission, self-insuring employer, bureau of workers' compensation, or their agent, for medical care rendered to a claimant does not imply or create a legal relationship between the provider or person and the commission, self-insuring employer, bureau, or their agent.

===================================================================



 

4123-6-42 Interest on late payments for equipment, materials, goods, supplies or services in state insurance fund, public work relief employees' compensation fund, coal workers pneumoconiosis fund, and marine industry fund claims.
(A) Payment is made for equipment, materials, goods, supplies, or services incurred by the claimant in connection with claims against the state insurance fund, public work relief employees' compensation fund, coal workers pneumoconiosis fund, or marine industry fund in accordance with section 126.30 of the Revised Code. For the purpose of this rule, the required payment date is the date on which payment is due under the terms of a written agreement between the bureau, or its agent, and the provider. Payment will be made either thirty days after the bureau, or its agent, receives a proper invoice for the amount of the payment due, or thirty days after the final adjudication allowing payment of an award to the claimant, whichever is later.
(1) A "proper invoice" includes but is not limited to the claimant's name, claim number, date of injury or occupational disease, employer's name, provider's name and address and assigned payee number, a description of the service provided, the procedure code for the service provided, the date provided, and the amount of the charge. If more than one item has been included in the invoice, each item is to be considered separately to determine if it is a proper invoice.
(2) If the bureau or its agent determines that an invoice is improper, the bureau or its agent shall send notification to the provider through the MCO at least fifteen days prior to what would be the required payment date if the invoice did not contain an error. The notice shall describe the error and the additional information needed to correct the error. The required payment date shall be redetermined upon receipt of a proper invoice.
(3) If an invoice is for payment of either a condition not allowed in a claim, or for a claim that is not allowed, the payment date is thirty days after final adjudication of allowance of the condition or claim. As defined in section 126.30 of the Revised Code, "final adjudication" is the date that the decision of the bureau, industrial commission, or court becomes final, with no further right of appeal. If any section of the Revised Code contains a faster timetable for payments, however, such provisions shall not be superseded by this rule.
(B) Interest shall be paid based on division (E) of section 126.30 of the Revised Code. Any interest charges payable under section 126.30 of the Revised Code are to be paid by the bureau of workers' compensation.

===================================================================



 

4123-6-43 Payment for transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulators and neuromuscular electrical stimulators.
(A) Payment will be approved for a transcutaneous electric nerve stimulator (TENS) unit for treatment of allowed conditions in a claim directly resulting from an allowed industrial injury or occupational disease, as provided in this rule.
(1) Prior authorization is required for TENS units and supplies. A claimant shall be provided only one TENS unit at a time. For each TENS unit request approved, the unit shall be rented for a thirty day trial period before purchase of the TENS unit. This trial period is to evaluate the medical necessity and effectiveness of the TENS treatment. TENS treatment will be discontinued at the end of the thirty day trial period month where the treatment has not proven to be medically necessary or effective. Reimbursement of rental costs will be considered only for the trial period that the TENS unit was actually used before treatment was discontinued. For each TENS unit provided, payment shall be limited to necessary disposable or rechargeable batteries, but not both.
(2) The bureau shall apply all rental payments previously made to the purchase price of the TENS unit. A TENS unit purchased and furnished to the claimant is not the personal property of the claimant, but remains the property of the bureau or self-insuring employer. The bureau or self-insuring employer reserves the right to reclaim and recover the TENS unit from the claimant at the completion of the course of TENS treatment. Once a TENS unit is purchased, the bureau or self-insuring employer will reimburse for repair or replacement of the unit upon submission of a request from the physician of record or treating provider that includes medical documentation substantiating the continued medical necessity and effectiveness of the unit.
(3) To be eligible for reimbursement under this rule, the TENS unit must be prescribed by a physician and furnished by a provider holding a current, valid, license or certificate of registration from the Ohio respiratory care board to sell or rent home medical equipment.
(B) The claimant's MCO shall regularly determine the specific TENS supplies needed by the claimant throughout the period of time authorized for TENS use. The TENS provider must receive authorization from the claimant's MCO prior to the delivery of supplies and/or equipment. The TENS provider shall then deliver the supplies and bill the claimant's MCO after authorization is received. A self-insuring employer may, but is not required to, follow the same procedure as an MCO under this rule; provided, however, that in no event shall a self-insuring employer require a claimant to submit a written request for TENS supplies and/or equipment. The claimant's MCO shall retain documentation of the contact with the claimant substantiating the claimant's need for supplies in accordance with the time frames set forth in rule 4123-6- 14.1 of the Administrative Code. The TENS provider's bill must indicate the actual date of service, reflecting the date that services or supplies were provided. The bureau, MCO, QHP, or self-insuring employer may adjust bills upon audit if the audit discloses the provider's failure to comply with this rule.
(C) The TENS provider shall maintain the following records and make them available for audit upon request:
(1) Authorizations of TENS supplies or equipment received from the injured worker's MCO, and all other documentation relating to the injured worker's need for TENS supplies or equipment received by the provider prior to the delivery of the supplies or equipment, including any requests received from the injured worker, if applicable;
(2) Records of the provider's wholesale purchase of TENS supplies or equipment;
(3) Records of delivery of supplies to injured workers and of the delivery or return of TENS units; and
(4) The TENS provider's current, valid, license or certificate of registration from the Ohio respiratory care board to sell or rent home medical equipment.
Upon request, the provider shall supply copies of the record information to the requester at no cost. Failure to provide the requested records may result in denial or adjustment of bills related to these records.
(D) The bureau shall not pay for the rental or sale of devices that are labeled by the food and drug administration (FDA) for over-the-counter use and are identified with the FDA product code "NUH.OTC.TENS."
(E) Payment will be approved for a neuromuscular electrical stimulator (NMES) unit for treatment of allowed conditions in a claim directly resulting from an allowed industrial injury or occupational disease, as provided in the bureau's provider billing and reimbursement manual in effect on the billed date of service.

(B) Upon any finding of improper or unnecessary medical care, the administrator shall, if requested by the provider, appoint a subcommittee of the stakeholders' health care quality assurance advisory committee to review and advise the administrator as provided in paragraph (F) of rule 4123-6-22 of the Administrative Code. The administrator may sanction, suspend, or exclude a health care provider from participation in the workers' compensation system based on rule 4123-6-17 of the Administrative Code.

(B) Initial review and decision upon requests for the delivery of medical services that include, but are not limited to, medical treatment, major diagnostic testing, hospitalization, surgery and physical therapy, shall be completed by the QHP. The employee, employer and provider shall be notified verbally of the outcome of the initial review within forty-eight hours of the request. Within seven working days of the verbal notification, the verbal notification shall be committed to writing and mailed to the employee, employer and provider.
(C) A QHP shall have a dispute resolution process beyond initial review that includes a minimum of two levels of peer review of a medical diagnosis or treatment issue if an individual health care provider is involved in the dispute, or a minimum of two levels of dispute resolution if an individual health care provider is not involved in the dispute.
(D) A QHP dispute resolution process shall be completed and the QHP shall notify the parties to the dispute and their initial written notice of a dispute, unless an extension of time is otherwise agreed to by the parties. Any party appealing a decision to a higher level within a QHP's dispute resolution process shall provide notice of such appeal to all the parties to the dispute within seven working days of notice of decision.
(E) The dispute resolution process shall begin upon written notice of the dispute by the party maintaining the dispute to the parties of the dispute. If an individual health care provider is involved in the dispute, there shall be available at least two levels of peer review if appealed, with at least one level conducted by an individual or individuals licensed pursuant to the same section of the revised code as the health care provider who is a party to the dispute. The other level of peer review shall include, at the discretion of the QHP medical director, one or more of the following: a review conducted by a multi-disciplinary medical panel or board; an independent or agreed upon medical examination; or the use of other resources beneficial to the resolution of the dispute.

Parties to a dispute shall exhaust the dispute resolution procedures of this rule prior to filing an appeal under section 4123.511 of the Revised Code.
(G) Notwithstanding the requirements set forth in paragraph (F) of this rule, a dispute unresolved by a QHP providing medical management and cost containment services for a state fund employer shall be referred by the QHP to the bureau within seven working days of the final decision rendered within the QHP dispute resolution process. Within fourteen days of receipt of an unresolved medical dispute, the bureau shall conduct an independent review of the unresolved medical dispute received from the QHP and enter a final bureau order pursuant to section 4123.511 of the Revised Code. This order shall be mailed to all parties and may be appealed to the industrial commission pursuant to section 4123.511 of the Revised Code.

===================================================================



 

4123-10-02 Procedures for accessing confidential personal information.
For personal information systems, whether manual or computer systems, that contain confidential personal information, the bureau shall do the following:
(A) Criteria for accessing confidential personal information. Personal information systems of the bureau are managed on a "need-to-know" basis whereby the information owner determines the level of access required for an employee of the bureau to fulfill his/her job duties. The determination of access to confidential personal information shall be approved by the employee's supervisor and the information owner prior to providing the employee with access to confidential personal information within a personal information system. The bureau shall establish procedures for determining a revision to an employee's access to confidential personal information upon a change to that employee's job duties including, but not limited to, transfer or termination. Whenever an employee's job duties no longer require access to confidential personal information in a personal information system, the employee's access to confidential personal information shall be removed.
(B) Individual's request for a list of confidential personal information. Upon the signed written request of any individual for a list of confidential personal information about the individual maintained by the bureau, the bureau shall do all of the following:
(1) Verify the identity of the individual by a method that provides safeguards commensurate with the risk associated with the confidential personal information;
(2) Provide to the individual the list of confidential personal information that does not relate to an investigation about the individual or is otherwise not excluded from the scope of Chapter 1347. of the Revised Code; and
(3) If all information relates to an investigation about that individual, inform the individual that the bureau has no confidential personal information about the individual that is responsive to the individual's request.
(C) Notice of invalid access.
(1) Upon discovery or notification that confidential personal information of a person has been accessed by an employee for an invalid reason, the bureau shall notify the person whose information was invalidly accessed as soon as practical and to the extent known at the time. However, the bureau shall delay notification for a period of time necessary to ensure that the notification would not delay or impede an investigation or jeopardize homeland or national security. Additionally, the bureau may delay the notification consistent with any measures necessary to determine the scope of the invalid access, including which individuals' confidential personal information invalidly was accessed, and to restore the reasonable integrity of the system.
"Investigation" as used in this paragraph means the investigation of the circumstances and involvement of an employee surrounding the invalid access of the confidential personal information. Once the bureau determines that notification would not delay or impede an investigation, the bureau shall disclose the access to confidential personal information made for an invalid reason to the person.
(2) Notification provided by the bureau shall inform the person of the type of confidential personal information accessed and the date(s) of the invalid access.
(3) Notification may be made by any method reasonably designed to accurately inform the person of the invalid access, including written, electronic, or telephone notice.
(D) Appointment of a data privacy point of contact. The administrator of the bureau shall designate an employee of the bureau to serve as the data privacy point of contact. The data privacy point of contact shall work with the chief privacy officer within the office of information technology to assist the bureau with both the implementation of privacy protections for the confidential personal information that the bureau maintains and compliance with section 1347.15 of the Revised Code and the rules adopted pursuant to the authority provided by that chapter.
(E) Completion of a privacy impact assessment. The agency director shall designate an employee of the bureau to serve as the data privacy point of contact who shall timely complete the privacy impact assessment form developed by the office of information technology.

===================================================================



 

4123-14-02 Procedures for the collection of premiums from non-complying employers.
(A) Whenever the bureau of workers' compensation finds that an employer that was subject to division (B)(2) of section 4123.01 of the Revised Code failed to comply with the law in matters of workers' compensation coverage, the bureau shall notify the employer in writing of such a finding. The notice shall outline the period of time during which the employer was an amenable employer, and shall specify that the employer has twenty days from the service of the notice to pay the applicable premium or penalty as required by law.
(B) If the employer does not pay the applicable premium or penalty within the twenty day period referred to in paragraph (A) of this rule, the bureau or its authorized agent shall immediately make an assessment of the amount due from the employer, in accordance with sections 4123.32 and 4123.37 of the Revised Code. The assessment shall be based on such information as may be in the possession of the bureau.
(C) The bureau or its authorized agent shall give the employer written notice of any action taken. The notice shall be mailed to the employer at its residence or usual place of business by certified mail with return receipt requested. The notice shall inform the employer that unless it files with the bureau within twenty days after receipt of the notice, a petition for reassessment in writing, verified under oath by the employer, or its authorized agent having knowledge of the facts, setting forth in detail the items of the assessment objected to and the reason for the objection, the assessment shall become final and the amount thereof shall be due and payable from the employer so assessed to the state insurance fund.
(D) The bureau or its authorized agent, under the authority of section 4123.78 of the Revised Code, shall file with the county recorder of any counties in which such employer's property may be located a certificate of the amount of premium and penalty due from such employer and the amount due shall be a lien from the date of filing against the real and personal property of the employer within each county in which such certificate is filed.
(E) In the event a petition objecting to the assessment is duly filed by the employer, the bureau shall reexamine the assessment. The matter shall then be referred to the administrator of workers' compensation, who may refer the matter to be set for a hearing before the bureau of workers' compensation adjudicating committee. The notice of hearing shall be mailed to the petitioner by certified mail and to its representative, setting forth the date, time and place of the hearing. It will be mailed to the parties, as indicated above, not less than fourteen days before the date of such a hearing. In justifiable cases an emergency hearing may be arranged.
(F) A copy of the administrator's finding and order shall be mailed by certified mail to the party assessed and by regular mail to the representative of such a party.
(G) If the administrator orders the employer to pay the assessment, payment shall become due ten days after the notice of the finding and order of the administrator was mailed to such employer.
(H) The employer has the right to appeal the administrator's decision to the court of common pleas of Franklin county upon the execution of a bond to the state in double the amount due and ordered paid by the bureau, upon the condition that the employer will pay any judgment and costs rendered against it for the premium, as provided in section 4123.37 of the Revised Code.
(I) When no petition objecting to the assessment is filed or when a finding is made affirming or modifying such an assessment after hearing, a certified copy of the assessment, as affirmed or modified, shall be filed by the bureau not later than twenty days from the date the order has become final, with the clerk of the common pleas court in any county in which the employer has property or in which the employer has a place of business, for the purpose of obtaining a judgment for the state against the employer in the amount shown on the assessment. As soon as the judgment is rendered, proper action shall be taken to levy execution on said judgment.
(J) However, an assessment or judgment, as outlined in the preceding paragraphs of this rule, shall not be a bar to the adjustment of the employer's account upon the employer furnishing his payroll records to the bureau.
(K) In addition to the procedures outlined in paragraphs (A) to (I) of this rule, the administrator of the bureau shall, in justifiable cases, certify the matter to the attorney general's office with a request that the employer be enjoined from further operation in accordance with section 4123.79 of the Revised Code and/or that criminal proceedings be instituted against the employer for penalties under division (C) of section 4123.99 of the Revised Code. Furthermore, in cases where the employer failed to furnish to the bureau the annual payroll report and other related information required by section 4123.26 of the Revised Code, a civil action shall be brought against such employer in the name of the state to collect the penalty, as provided in that section.
(L) For counties and public employer taxing districts, the bureau shall keep an individual account showing the amount of money paid into the public insurance fund and the amount of losses incurred against the fund. When any such employer defaults in the payment of sums required to be contributed to such fund or any official fails to perform any act required to be performed in reference to the making of payments, the bureau shall institute the proper proceedings in the court to compel such payment.

===================================================================



 

4123-15-02 Policy.
(A) It is essential that the public has confidence in the administration of the industrial commission and the bureau of workers' compensation. This public confidence depends in a large degree on whether the public trusts that employees of these agencies are impartial, fair, and act only in the interest of the people, uninfluenced by any consideration of self-interest, except those inherent in the proper performance of their duties. Each employee, of whatever position, should, therefore, maintain the highest standards of personal integrity, since the public often judges the actions of an employee as reflecting the standards of the employing agency.
(B) The industrial commission and the bureau of workers' compensation are entrusted with the collection and distribution of a large fund. Their employees must respect this trust and should welcome public scrutiny of the way in which they perform their duties in connection with the administration of this fund. They should be willing to accept restrictions on their conduct that may not be necessary of public employees in other agencies, who are not in similar positions of trust. They must avoid not only impropriety, but the appearance of impropriety.

All segments of the public are to be treated equally, without regard to age, race, sex, religion, country of origin, or handicap.
(G) It is understood that standards of ethical conduct may involve a myriad of situations.

(1) Using public office for private gain, or
(2) Giving preferential treatment to any person, entity, or group.
(H) Confidential information.
The confidentiality of all information which comes into possession of commission and bureau employees shall be respected.

===================================================================



 

4123-17-02 Basic or manual rate.
(A) The "basic or manual rate" is hereby expressed as the unit of premium per one hundred dollars of payroll for accident and disease coverage.
(B) Succeeding employers -- experience.
(1) Where one legal entity, not having coverage in the most recent experience period, wholly succeeds another legal entity in the operation of a business, his or its rate shall be based on the predecessor's experience within the most recent experience period.
(2) Where a legal entity having an established coverage or having had experience in the most recent experience period wholly succeeds one or more legal entities having established coverage or having had experience in the most recent experience period and at least one of the entities involved has a merit rating experience, the experience of all the involved entities shall be combined to establish the rate of the successor.
(3) Where a legal entity succeeds in the operation of a portion of a business of one or more legal entities having an established coverage or having had experience in the most recent experience period, the successor's rate shall be based on the predecessor's experience within the most recent experience period, pertaining to the portion of the business acquired by the successor.
Pursuant to this rule, the bureau shall provide to the parties to the transfer of experience the necessary forms and instructions to complete the transfer of the appropriate payrolls and claims. Each party to the transfer of experience shall sign the completed forms. The bureau shall review the completed forms and if any questions arise, the bureau may conduct a premium audit on each party's risk account.
(4) When any combination or transfer of experience is indicated under any of the provisions of this rule, the effective date of such combination or transfer shall be the beginning date of the next following payroll reporting period. In cases where an entity not having coverage wholly succeeds another entity or in cases where the date of succession is determined to be January first or July first, the experience of the predecessor shall be transferred to the successor-employer effective as of the actual date of succession.
(5) For an out of state employer purchasing an existing Ohio operation, the bureau may use the out of state experience of the employer as a factor in determining the employer's experience.
(6) In addition to paragraphs (B)(1) to (B)(5) of this rule, and regardless of whether the predecessor's transfer to the successor was voluntary or through an intermediary bank or receivership, the bureau shall transfer the predecessor's experience under the workers' compensation law to the successor if any of the following criteria are met:

Where one employer wholly succeeds another in the operation of a business, the bureau shall transfer the predecessor's rights and obligations under the workers' compensation law to the successor.
(2) In addition to paragraph (C)(1) of this rule and regardless of whether the predecessor's transfer to the successor was voluntary or through an intermediary bank or receivership, the bureau shall transfer the predecessor's rights and obligations under the workers' compensation law to the successor if any of the following criteria are met:
(a) The successor expressly or impliedly agrees to assume such obligations;
(b) The succession transaction amounts to a de facto consolidation or merger;
(c) The successor is merely a continuation of the predecessor; or
(d) The succession transaction is entered into for the purpose of escaping obligations under the workers' compensation law.

===================================================================



 

4123-17-03 Employer's classification rates.
(A) Definitions.
As used in this rule:
(1) "Experience period" means:
(a) For private employer policy years commencing prior to July 1, 2016, the oldest four of the latest five calendar years immediately preceding the beginning of the policy year to which a rate is applicable.
(b) For private employer policy years commencing on or after July 1, 2016, the oldest four of the latest five completed policy years immediately preceding the beginning of the policy year to which a rate is applicable.
(c) For public employer taxing districts policy years commencing prior to January 1, 2016, the oldest four of the last five calendar years immediately preceding the beginning of the policy year to which the rate is applicable.
(d) For public employer taxing districts policy years commencing on or after January 1, 2016, the oldest four of the last five completed calendar years immediately preceding the beginning of the policy year to which the rate is applicable.
(2) "Inactive employer" means an employer that satisfies all of the following criteria:
(a) The employer is assigned a "cancelled" policy status or a "no coverage" policy, and
(b) As of the last day of September for private employers, or the last day of March for public employers, the employer is not paying premiums or assessments to the Ohio state insurance fund under either its own identity, the identity of any successor entity, or as a self-insured entity .
(3) "Significant negative impact" occurs when:
(a) Inactive employers reported forty per cent or more of the payroll in a manual classification in any calendar year in the experience period for policy years commencing before July 1, 2016, and in any policy year for the policy years commencing on or after July 1, 2016, and
(b) The aggregate loss rate and loss-to-premium ratio of inactive employers in the manual classification are significantly higher than the aggregate loss rate and loss-to-premium ratio of the active employers taken as a whole as measured over the relevant experience period.
(B) An employer's premium rates shall be the manual rates as provided under rules 4123-17-02, 4123-17-06, and 4123-17-34 of the Administrative Code for each of its classifications except as modified by the employer's experience rating, and shall apply for the twelve-month period beginning on the first of July for private employers and for the calendar year beginning on the first of January for public employer taxing districts.
(1) In calculating the manual rate under this rule, the bureau shall exclude the experience of an inactive employer if the inclusion of that employer's experience would have a significant negative impact upon the remaining employers in a particular manual classification. The bureau shall exclude the data of that inactive employer from all future manual classification rate calculations.
(2) The calculation of the manual rate and the experience rate in paragraph (B)(1) of this rule shall be applied to all employers reporting payroll in the manual classification.
(3) Once the bureau has determined that the loss data of a specific inactive employer shall be removed from the manual classification experience, the bureau shall exclude the data of that employer from all future manual classification rate calculations. If that inactive employer reactivates its policy, the bureau shall include the loss data in rate calculations for the manual classification.
(C) An experience-rated employer's manual classification experience-modified rate
shall be determined by multiplying its experience modification (EM) as defined in paragraph (D) of this rule times the manual rate for each of the employer's assigned manual classifications.
(D) The experience modification is determined in accordance with the following formula:
 

TML = Actual losses of the employer for the experience period, limited in accordance with paragraph (E)(1) of this rule.
TLL = Total limited losses = TEL multiplied by LLR
TEL = Total expected losses, determined by applying expected loss rate to the payroll of each classification in the employer's experience period, as provided in the appendix to rule 4123-17-05.1 of the Administrative Code for private employers and in the appendix to rule 4123-17-33.1 of the Administrative Code for public employer taxing districts. The total expected losses are then used to determine credibility group, credibility, and the maximum value of a loss.
LLR = Limited loss ratio, calculated for each credibility group within each industry group, as provided in appendix B to rule 4123-17-05 of the Administrative Code for private employers and appendix B to rule 4123-17-33 of the Administrative Code for public employer taxing districts.
C = Credibility given to an employer's own experience, determined by the employer's total expected losses, as provided in the appendix to rule 4123-17-05.1 of the Administrative Code for private employers and in the appendix to rule 4123-17-33.1 of the Administrative Code for public employer taxing districts.
(E) Experience modification (EM) shall be subject to the following conditions and limitations:
(1) Actual losses shall include all incurred costs but shall be limited as provided in rule 4123-17-12 of the Administrative Code, and at the claim level to the amounts provided in the appendix to rule 4123-17-05.1 of the Administrative Code for private employers and the appendix to rule 4123-17-33.1 of the Administrative Code for public employer taxing districts according to the total expected losses of an employer; and
(2) An employer shall not be eligible for experience modification of manual rates unless its expected losses are at least the minimum amount as provided in the appendix to rule 4123-17-05.1 of the Administrative Code for private employers and the appendix to rule 4123-17-33.1 of the Administrative Code for public employer taxing districts.
(3) The year-over-year increase in an employer's EM may be limited to one hundred per cent pursuant to rule 4123-17-03.2 of the Administrative Code.

4123-17-03.2 Experience modification cap.
(A) Definitions.
As used in this rule:
(1) "Eligibility determination date" means the March first immediately preceding the policy year for which the EM is being calculated for private employers, and the September first immediately preceding the policy year for which the EM is being calculated for public employer taxing districts.
(2) "Experience modification" or "EM" means the experience modification as determined under rule 4123-17-03 of the Administrative Code.
(3) "Safety requirement completion date" means the last business day of March for private employers and the last business day of September for public employer taxing districts.
(B) Except as provided for in paragraph (D) of this rule, the bureau shall limit the increase in EM of an employer meeting the eligibility requirements of this rule to one hundred per cent of the initial EM calculated for that employer in the preceding rating year.
(C) Eligibility requirements.
(1) As of the eligibility determination date,
(a) The employer must be current with respect to all payments due the bureau, as defined in paragraph (A)(1)(b) of rule 4123-17-14 of the Administrative Code.
(b) Except as provided for in paragraphs (C)(1)(b)(i) and (C)(1)(b)(ii) of this rule, the employer must not have cumulative lapses in workers' compensation coverage in excess of forty days within the preceding twelve months.
(i) For the policy year commencing July 1, 2015, private employers must not have cumulative lapses in workers' compensation coverage in excess of forty days within the preceding nine months.
(ii) For policy year commencing January 1, 2016, public employer taxing districts must not have cumulative lapses in workers' compensation coverage in excess of forty days within the preceding nine months.
(2) An employer must annually complete a safety program prescribed by the division of safety and hygiene no later than safety requirement completion date during each policy year in which the cap applies. If the employer fails to comply with these requirements, the bureau will remove the cap for the policy year in which the requirements were not met and use employer's uncapped EM for that policy year.
(3) An employer must report actual payroll for the preceding policy year and pay any premium due upon reconciliation of estimated premium and actual premium for that policy year no later than the date set forth in rule 4123-17-14 of the Administrative Code.
An employer will be deemed to have met this requirement if the bureau receives the payroll report and the employer pays premium associated with such report before the expiration of any grace period established by the administrator pursuant to paragraph (B) of rule 4123-17-16 of the Administrative Code.
(D) An employer removed from the EM cap program for failure to meet the criteria set forth in paragraph (C)(3) of this rule will be rerated for the full policy year at the employer's base rate or experience-modified rate as determined by the employer's expected losses for the policy year.
(E) Opt-out provision.
The bureau will automatically apply the cap to an employer that meets the eligibility requirements of paragraphs (C)(1)(a) and (C)(1)(b) of this rule. An employer may voluntarily withdraw from the EM cap program by providing written notice to the bureau.
(F) Application of cap to successor policies.
(1) Where a transfer of experience occurs pursuant to rule 4123-17-02 of the Administrative Code, the resulting EM is not subject to limitation under this rule unless one of the following apply:
(a) The transfer is a combination as a result of bankruptcy proceedings, when the transaction is a change in risk number without any change in exposure; or
(b) A base-rated successor wholly or partially succeeds a single policy.
(2) If the criteria in paragraph (F)(1)(a) or (F)(1)(b) of this rule are met, the predecessor's published EM in the preceding rating year will be the EM published for the successor in the same rating year for purposes of determining whether the cap applies under this rule.

--->ohio--->Ohio Rules--->Chapter 4123: Bureau of Workers' Compensation--->Chapter 4123-17 General Rating for the State Insurance Fund--->4123-17-08 Classifications according to national council on compensation insurance. 
===================================================================



 

4123-17-08 Classifications according to national council on compensation insurance.
In accordance with division (A)(1) of section 4123.29 of the Revised Code, the purpose of this rule is for the bureau of workers' compensation to conform the classifications of industries according to the categories the national council on compensation insurance (NCCI) establishes that are applicable to employers in Ohio. This rule is based upon "Rule 1, Classification Assignment," effective January 1, 2002, of the classification rules of the NCCI and "Rule 2G, Interchange of Labor." The rule is used with the permission of the NCCI and is modified to conform to the requirements of the Ohio administrative code and the bureau of workers' compensation. Where the NCCI scopes of basic manual classifications contains additional rules and information relating to the reporting of payroll or classification of industries under the manual classifications, such scopes and rules shall apply under the rules of the bureau of workers' compensation, unless otherwise specifically excepted.
(A) Classification system.
(1) The purpose of the classification system is to group employers with similar operations into classifications so that:
(a) The assigned classification reflects the exposures common to those employers.
(b) The rate charged reflects the exposure to loss common to those employers.
(2) Subject to certain exceptions, it is the business of the employer within a state that is classified, not separate employments, occupations or operations within the business.
(B) Explanation of classifications.
Classifications are divided into two types - basic classifications and standard exception classifications.
(1) Basic classifications.
Basic classifications describe the business of an employer. This term is applied to all classifications listed in this manual, except for the standard exception classifications.
Examples of classifications that describe the business of the employer include:
(a) Business: manufacture of a product = classification: furniture manufacturing.
(b) Business: a process = classification: engraving.
(c) Business: construction or erection = classification: carpentry.
(d) Business: a mercantile business = classification: hardware store.
(e) Business: a service = classification: beauty salon.
(2) Standard exception classifications.
Standard exception classifications describe occupations that are common to many businesses. These common occupations are not included in a basic classification unless specified in the classification working. The standard exception classifications are described below.
(a) Clerical office or drafting employees NOC (code 8810); clerical office or drafting telecommuter employees (code 8871).
The above classifications are assigned when all the following conditions are met: the basic classification(s) wording applicable to the business does not include clerical office, drafting or telecommuting employees; other rules do not prohibit the assignment of code 8810 or code 8871; and the employee meets the duties, site and other requirements listed below:
(i) Duties.
Duties must be limited to one or more of the following work activities:
(a) Creation or maintenance of employer records, correspondence, computer programs, files.
(b) Drafting.
(c) Telephone duties, including telephone sales.
(d) Data entry or word processing.
(e) Copy or fax machine operations, unless the insured is in the business of making copies or faxing for the public.
(f) General office work similar in nature to the above.
(ii) Site.
(a) Code 8810 - the duties above must take place in a work station that is separated from the operative hazards of:
(i) Factories.
(ii) Stores;
(iii) Shops;
(iv) Construction sites;
(v) Warehouses;
(vi) Yards;
(vii) Any other work areas such as:
(A) Work or service areas.
(B) Areas where inventory is located.
(C) Areas where products are displayed for sale.
(D) Areas to which the purchaser customarily brings the product from another area for payment.
(b) Work stations or service areas as described in paragraph (B)(2)(a)(ii)(a) of this rule must be physically separated by:
(i) Floors.
(ii) Walls.
(iii) Partitions.
(iv) Counters.
(v) Other physical barriers that protect the clerical employee from the operating hazards of a business.
(c) Code 8871 - the duties above must take place in a clerical work area located within the home of the clerical employee. It must be separate and distinct from the location of the employer.
(iii) Other requirements.
(a) Employees who otherwise meet the requirements for code 8810 or code 8871 will not be disqualified from assignment to this classification if they perform certain incidental duties directly related to that employee's duties in the office. These duties include:
(i) Depositing of funds in a bank.
(ii) Pickup or delivery of mail.
(iii) Purchase of office supplies.
(iv) Entering an area exposed to the operative hazards of the business for clerical purposes, such as delivering paychecks.
(b) Employees who otherwise meet the requirements for code 8810 or code 8871 will be disqualified from assignment to this classification if their duties involve:
(i) Outside sales or outside representatives.
(ii) Direct supervision of nonclerical employees not performed in an eligible site according to paragraph (B)(2)(a)(ii)(a) of this rule.
(iii) Physical labor.
(iv) Any work exposed to the operative hazards of the business, such as a stock or tally clerk, that is necessary, incidental, or related to any operations of the business other than a clerical office.
(b) Drivers, chauffeurs and their helpers NOC - commercial (code 7380).
This classification is assigned to employees who perform work on or in connection with a vehicle. This code includes garage employees and employees using bicycles as part of their work duties. Duties include, but are not limited to, delivering goods owned by the employer.
Code 7380 does not apply when the basic classification wording includes drivers.
(c) Salespersons, collectors or messengers - outside (code 8742).
This classification is assigned to employees who perform these duties away from the employer's premises.
This code excludes employees who:
(i) Deliver merchandise.
(ii) Use vehicles to deliver or pick up goods, even if they collect or sell. These employees must be assigned to the classification applicable to the business for drivers.
(iii) Use public transportation or walk to deliver goods, even if they collect or sell. These employees must be assigned to the governing classification applicable to the business.
Code 8742 does not apply when the basic classification wording includes outside salespersons, collectors or messengers.
(d) Automotive salespersons (code 8748).
This classification is assigned to employees who perform these duties on or away from the employer's premises. These employees are subject to the same rules and treatment as salespersons, collectors, or messengers - outside.
(3) General inclusions.
Some operations appear to be separate businesses but are included within all basic classifications. These are called general inclusions. These operations are not separately classified. They include the following:
(a) Restaurants or cafeterias operated by the insured for employee use. Exception: if these operations are conducted in connection with construction, erection, lumbering or mining operations, they must be separately classified.
(b) Manufacture of containers by the insured, such as bags, barrels, bottles, boxes, cans, cartons or packing cases for sole use in the operations insured by the policy.
(c) Hospitals or medical facilities operated by the insured for its employees.
(d) Maintenance or repair of the insured's buildings or equipment by the insured's employees.
(e) Printing or lithographing by the insured on its own products.
Some employees may perform general inclusion duties for more than one basic classification. In such cases, refer to paragraph (F) of this rule for classification treatment.
Exceptions:
A general inclusion operation must be separately classified if:
(i) The operation is conducted as a separate and distinct business of the insured (refer to paragraph (D)(3) of this rule.)
(ii) The operation is specifically excluded in the wording of the basic classification.
(iii) The principal business is described by a standard exception classification.
(4) General exclusions.
Some operations in a business are so unusual for the type of business described by the applicable basic classification, that they are separately classified even though the operations are not conducted as a secondary business. These are called general exclusions. They are:
(a) Aircraft operations - all operations of the flying and ground crews.
(b) New construction or alterations.
(c) Stevedoring.
(d) Sawmill operations.
(e) Employer-operated day care service.
(5) Governing classification.
The governing classification at a specific job or location is the classification, other than a standard exception classification, that produces the greatest amount of payroll.
If a basic classification is not applicable, the governing classification is the standard exception classification that produces the greatest amount of payroll.
The governing classification is used to determine the classification treatment of:
(a) Miscellaneous employees.
(b) Local managers.
(c) Executive officers who regularly engage in duties that are ordinarily performed by a superintendent, foreperson or worker.
Example of a governing classification: a business has the following payroll amounts assigned to the following classifications: $220,000 for code 2003 (bakery); $120,000 for code 8017 (store; retail); and $240,000 for code 8810 (clerical).
The governing code for this business is code 2003 because it is the classification code, other than the standard exception code (code 8810), with the greatest amount of payroll.
(6) Principal business.
Principal business is described by the classification, other than a standard exception or general exclusion, with the greatest amount of payroll.
If the business is best described by a standard exception operation, and there is no basic classification other than the general inclusion or exclusion operations, then the standard exception operation that produces the greatest amount of payroll for the business is considered the principal business.
(C) Classification wording.
The following list provides an explanation of classification wording usage.
(1) Classification captions and notes.
The "caption" is the heading that precedes the classification itself and is part of the classification wording.
The "note" is the phrase that follows the classification and is part of the classification wording.
The classification wording, including captions and notes, controls, restricts or explains the classification usage.
Example of a classification entry:
Store: fruit or vegetable - retail. No handling of fresh meats; "store" is the caption in the example and "no handling of fresh meats" is the note.
(2) Words and phrases.
(a) All employees, all other employees, all operations, or all operations to completion.
If a classification includes any of these phrases, no other classification can be assigned unless noted in the classification wording. This applies even if some operations or employees are at a separate location.
Examples of classifications that include "all employees," "all other employees," all operations," or "all operations to completion"
(i) Code 9186 (carnival, circus or amusement device operator -traveling - all employees & drivers); all employees must be assigned to this classification.
(ii) Code 7382 (bus co.: all other employees & drivers); all employees, other than garage employees, must be assigned to code 7382, not 8385;
(iii) Code 5402 (greenhouse erection-all operations); all work for the erection of a greenhouse must be assigned to this classification.
(iv) Code 6005 (jetty or breakwater construction-all operations to completion & drivers); all work for the construction of a jetty from the beginning to the end of the project must be assigned to this classification.
Exceptions:
The following operations within the business must be classified separately even if the classification wording includes "all employees," "all other employees," "all operations," or "all operations to completion"
(a) Construction or erection permanent yard (code 8227).
(b) Contractor - executive supervisor or construction superintendent (code 5606).
(c) Classifications describing an operation that is a standard exception unless the basic classification includes the standard exception operation.
(d) Classifications describing an operation that is a general exclusion.
(e) Any separate and distinct business (refer to paragraph (D)(3)(c) of this rule).
(b) Clerical.
Clerical means clerical office employees and drafting employees as defined in paragraph (B)(2)(a) of this rule.
Clerical includes clerical telecommuters as defined in paragraph (B)(2)(a) of this rule.
(c) Drivers.
Drivers means drivers, chauffeurs, and their helpers as defined in paragraph (B)(2)(b) of this rule.
(d) "Includes" or "&."
If the classification wording uses the terms "includes" or "&," the operation or employees cited after those terms must not be assigned to a separate classification. This applies even though the operation or employees may be described by another classification or are at a separate location.
Examples of classification that include the terms "includes" or "&":
(i) Code 0005 (farm: nursery employees & drivers); all drivers must be assigned to this classification.
(ii) Code 4829 (chemical mfg. NOC - all operations & drivers -includes blending or mixing); all drivers and all blending and mixing operations must be assigned to this classification.
(iii) Code 8832 (physician & clerical); all clerical employees must be included in this classification.
Note: if an insured's operations are assigned to more than one basic classification, an employee's payroll may be allocated among codes appropriate for each operation. This procedure is provided under paragraph (F) of this rule, interchange of labor.
(e) Local manager.
Local manager is an employee, regardless of title, who is in direct charge of the operative procedures in the yard of a business. This employee is subject to the hazards of the business. Therefore, the payroll of the local manager must be assigned to the governing classification unless another basic classification assigned to the business specifically includes this employee.
(f) "No" or "Not."
A classification that includes a restrictive phrase beginning with "no" or "not" must not apply to any risk that conducts any operation described in the restrictive phrase.
Examples of classifications that include the terms "no" or "not":
(i) Code 2143 (fruit juice mfg.-no bottling of carbonated liquids); this code cannot be assigned to a business that manufactures fruit juice if it also bottles carbonated liquids.
(ii) Code 4611 (drug, medicine or pharmaceutical preparation-no mfg. of ingredients); this code cannot be assigned to a business preparing drugs, medicines, or pharmaceuticals if the business also manufactures the ingredients.
(iii) Code 8106 (steel merchant-not applicable to junk dealers); this code cannot be assigned to a steel merchant if that business also deals in junk.
Exception: for mercantile, mining or construction operations, this rule applies to each job or location.
(g) "NOC."
"NOC" means "not otherwise classified." If the classification wording uses the term "NOC", that classification applies only if no other classification more specifically describes the insured's business.
Examples of classification that include the term "NOC":
(i) Code 2688 (leather goods mfg. NOC).
(ii) Code 3022 (pipe or tube mfg. NOC & drivers).
(iii) Code 8017 (store: retail NOC).
None of the above codes will be assigned to a business if there is another code that more specifically and accurately applies to that business.
(h) "Or" or "And."
The terms "or" or "and" mean and/or.
Examples of classifications that include the term "or" or "and":
(i) Code 2586 (cleaning or dyeing); a business that does cleaning and/or dyeing is classified to this code.
(ii) Code 4720 (soap or synthetic detergent mfg.); a business that manufactures soap and/or synthetic detergents is classified to this code.
(iii) Code 7600 (Telecommunications Co. - cable TV/Satellite - all employees and drivers); a business that installs overhead telephone and/or cable TV lines is classified to this code.
(i) Salespersons.
Salespersons means salespersons, collectors, and messengers as defined in paragraph (B)(2)(c) of this rule.
(j) Stories in height.
Certain classification wording refers to "stories in height." A story is defined as fifteen feet in height. It is measured from the lowest point above ground level to the highest point above ground level. Some of these classifications are:
(i) Code 5037 (painting: metal structures - over two stories).
(ii) Code 5059 (iron or steel-erection-frame structures not over two stories).
(k) To be separately rated.
Certain classification wording contains the phrase "to be separately rated." Operations or employees referenced in those classifications must be separately classified.
Examples of classifications that include the term "to be separately rated":
(i) Code 2111 (cannery NOC can mfg. to be separately rated as code 3220); in a business that cans foods, the manufacturing of the cans must separately classified to code 3220.
(ii) Code 4131 (mirror mfg.-mfg. of glass, frames, backs, or handles to be separately rated); in a business that makes mirrors, the work of producing glass, or fabricating frames, backs, or handles must be separately classified.
(iii) Code 8107 (machinery dealer NOC-store or yard & drivers, operations away from premises, other than demonstration or repair, to be separately rated); in a business that is a machinery dealer, work other than demonstrating or repairing the equipment that is not done at the insured's location must be separately classified.
Rules regarding the assignment of more than one basic classification apply. Refer to paragraph (D)(3) of this rule.
(D) Classification procedures.
The purpose of the classification procedure is to assign the one basic classification that best describes the business of the employer within a state. Subject to certain exceptions described in this rule, each classification includes all the various types of labor found in a business.
It is the business that is classified, not the individual employments, occupations or operations within the business.
Certain exceptions apply and are noted below.
(1) Separate legal entities.
Classification rules apply separately to each legal entity operating in a state even if multiple entities are insured under a single policy
(2) Businesses not described by a classification.
If no basic classification clearly describes the business, the classification that most closely describes the business must be assigned. All the rules pertaining to the assigned basic classification apply to this operation.
(3) Assignment of more than one basic classification.
More than one basic classification may be assigned to an insured who meets conditions set forth in paragraphs (D)(3)(a) to (D)(3)(c) of this rule. Operation means activities, enterprises, processes, secondary businesses or undertakings.
(a) The insured's principal business is described by a basic classification that requires certain operations or employees to be separately rated.
(b) The insured conducts one or more of the following operations:
(i) Construction or erection.
(ii) Farming.
(iii) Employee leasing, labor contracting, temporary labor services.
(iv) Mercantile business.
(c) The insured conducts more than one operation in a state.
(i) For purposes of this rule, an insured is conducting more than one operation in a state if portions of the insured's operations in that state are not encompassed by the classification applicable to the insured's principal business. To qualify for a separate classification, the insured's additional operation must:
(a) Be able to exist as a separate business if the insured's principal business in the state ceased to exist.
(b) Be located in a separate building, or on a separate floor in the same building, or on the same floor physically separated from the principal business by structural partitions. Employees engaged in the principal business must be protected from the operating hazards of the separate additional operations.
(c) Maintain proper payroll records. Refer to paragraph (F)(2) of this rule on maintenance of proper payroll records.
Example of two operations that could qualify as two separate businesses: an insured operates bowling lanes and a movie theater. These distinct operations can qualify as two separate businesses for classification purposes because:
(i) The operations of bowling lanes and movie theaters are not ordinarily conducted as one business, and therefore, are not included within each other's scope.
(ii) Either the bowling lane (if the movie theater ceases to exist) or the movie theater (if the bowling lane cease to exist) can be expected to continue its operations.
Examples of operations that must be separately classified because they are specifically excluded in the wording of a classification considered to be the insured's principal business:
(A) Code 0251 (irrigation works operation & drivers); code 0251 and the farm classification cannot be assigned to the same risk unless the operations described by these classifications are conducted as separate and distinct businesses. Irrigation system construction must be separately rated as code 6229.
(B) Code 5059 (iron or steel: erection-frame structures not over two stories in height); code 5040-iron or steel: erection-frame structures cannot be assigned to the same job or location that code 5059 applies to.
(C) Code 8265 (iron or steel scrap dealer & drivers); wrecking or salvaging must be separately rated. This code cannot be assigned to a risk engaged in an operation described by another classification unless the operations subject to Code 8265 are conducted as a separate and distinct business.
(ii) If the separate additional operation is not encompassed in the classification applicable to the insured's principal business and meets all the conditions listed above in paragraph (D)(3)(c)(i) of this rule, the insured is considered to be engaged in an additional operation. If this is the case, a separate basic classification may be assigned to each operation that qualified as a separate additional operation.
(iii) If the additional operation does not meet all conditions listed above in paragraph (D)(3)(c)(i) of this rule and is not encompassed in the classification applicable to the insured's principal business and has a rate:
(a) Lower than the insured's principal business, assign this operation to the same classification as the insured's principal business.
(b) Higher than or equal to the insured's principal business, assign this operation to the classification that describes the additional operation.
(iv) Policies with more than one classification may include employees working under several classifications. Payroll assignment for these employees is subject to the interchange of labor rule. Refer to paragraph (F) of this rule.
(d) Construction or erection operations.
These operations are identified by a "circle" immediately following the code number.
Each distinct type of construction or erection operation must be assigned to the class that specifically describes the operation only if separate payroll records are maintained for each operation.
If separate payroll records are not maintained for any construction or erection operation, the highest rated classification that applies to the job or location where the operation is performed must be assigned.
If a construction or erection operation is included in the scope of another classification, a separate code must not be assigned.
(i) Insured subcontractors.
An insured subcontractor who performs a single type of work on a construction project or job just be classified based on the classification that describes the particular work involved.
Example of how to classify the work performed by an insured subcontractor:
The insured subcontractor who performs only excavation work in connection with the construction of a sewer is classified under code 6217 (excavation) rather than under code 6306 (sewer construction).
Exception: all operations in conjunction with concrete construction including making and erecting forms, placing reinforcing steel and stripping forms, when done by subcontractors, must be assigned to the appropriate concrete construction classification.
(ii) Uninsured subcontractors.
Uninsured subcontractors covered under the principal or general contractor's policy are classified on the basis of the classification that would apply if the work were performed by the principal's own employees.
Example of how to classify the work performed by an uninsured subcontractor:
The uninsured subcontractor who performs only excavation work, but is covered under the policy of the principal contractor who is performing the construction of a sewer, is classified under code 6306 (sewer construction).
(e) Farm operations.
These operations are identified by a "square" immediately following the code number.
A farm is defined as any parcel(s) of land used for the purpose of agriculture, horticulture, viticulture, dairying, or stock or poultry raising as a business or commercial venture.
If separate payroll records are maintained, a division of payroll is allowed for each separate and distinct type of commercial farm operation.
If payroll records of the farm classification are not clear, and separate payroll records are not maintained, the entire payroll of the farm must be segregated on the basis of proportionate acreages.
Each farm classification includes:
(i) All employees.
(ii) Drivers.
(iii) All normal repair and maintenance of buildings or equipment performed by the employees of the insured.
(iv) Operations usual and incidental to a farm, such as:
(a) Maintenance of cows, hogs or chickens for family use.
(b) A family orchard or truck garden.
(c) Hay or grain crops raised for the purpose of maintaining work animals on the farm.
(d) Outside domestic workers at the farm location.
Each farm classification excludes inside domestic workers at the farm location.
(f) Employee leasing, labor contractors and temporary labor services.
(i) Workers assigned to clients must be classified the same as direct employees of the client performing the same or similar duties.
(ii) If the client has no direct employees performing the same or similar duties, leased employees are classified as if they were direct employees of the client entity.
Example of how to classify workers assigned to clients of employee leasing companies, labor contractors, and temporary labor services:
The client is a retail store classified to code 8017:
(a) Code 8017 is applicable to the worker assigned as a cashier, just as it is applicable to the client's employee who works as a cashier.
(b) Code 7380 is applicable to the worker assigned as a delivery truck driver, just as it is applicable to the client's employee who drives a delivery truck.
(g) Mercantile businesses.
These operations are identified by a "diamond" immediately following the code number.
A mercantile business is any store or dealer engaged in the sale of goods or merchandise, or in the sale of services.
For mercantile businesses, the classification is assigned separately for each location.
Store operations are classified based on the principal type of merchandise sold and whether the operations are wholesale or retail. For purposes of the rule, principal means more than fifty per cent of gross receipts, excluding receipts derived from the sale of lottery tickets.
The following definitions and instructions must be used to determine the appropriate store classification.
(i) Type of merchandise sold.
If a store sells a variety of goods, each of which may be subject to a different classification, the store must be assigned to the classification that best describes the merchandise that generates more than fifty per cent of the gross receipts.
(ii) Wholesale vs. retail.
Retail applies to the sale of merchandise to the general public for personal or household consumption or use and not for resale.
Wholesale applies to the sale of merchandise for resale to others; or sale to manufacturers, builders, contractors, or others for use in their business or as raw materials.
Exception: if a store's sales are clearly retail in nature, the appropriate retail store classification may be assigned regardless of the definition of retail above.
Examples of store sales that are clearly retail in nature:
(a) A store selling artwork in a shopping mall whose majority of sales are for artwork purchased by businesses.
(b) A store selling art supplies in a shopping mall whose majority of sales are to artists who use the materials in their business.
(iii) Combination of retail and wholesale.
A store that sells merchandise on a combined wholesale and retail basis must be assigned to the appropriate store classification depending on whether the majority of gross receipts come from wholesale or retail sales.
(4) Standard exceptions.
Standard exceptions must be separately classified unless specifically included in a classification assigned to the business.
Classifications for standard exceptions apply even if the basic classification includes phrases such as "all employees" or "all operations."
Examples of classifications that include "all employees" or "all operations" but do not specifically refer to any standard exception employees:
(a) Code 6260 (tunneling-pneumatic-all operations); this classification does not specifically include any standard exception employees. Those employees are separately classified to codes 8810, 8871, 8742, and 7380.
(b) Code 8829 (convalescent or nursing home-all employees); this classification does not specifically include any standard exception employees. Those employees are separately classified to codes 8810, 8871, 8742, and 7380.
Examples of classifications that specifically include standard exception employees:
(i) Code 4361 (photographer-all employees & clerical, salespersons, drivers); this classification specifically includes clerical employees, salespersons, and drivers. For this type of business, those employees are not separately classified to codes 8810, 8871, 8742, and 7380.
(ii) Code 9061 (club NOC & clerical); this classification specifically includes clerical employees. For this type of business, those employees of this type of business are not eligible for classification to code 8810 or 8871.
(5) Businesses described by a standard exception classification.
If the principal business is described by a standard exception classification, the operations of all employees not included in the definition of standard exception classification must be assigned to the separate basic classification that most closely describes their operation.
Example of principal business that is described by a standard exception code: the insured is a public museum:
(a) Professional and clerical employees are assigned to code 8810.
(b) Maintenance employees are assigned to code 9101.
(c) Gift shop employees are assigned to code 8017.
(6) Classifications limited to separate businesses.
The assignment of certain classifications is limited by their notes to separate and distinct businesses because the notes may describe an operation that frequently is an integral part of a business described by another classification.
Example of assignment of a classification limited by a note:
(a) Code 4511 ( Analytical laboratories or assaying - including laboratory, outside employees, collectors of samples, and drivers); cannot be assigned to a risk engaged in operations described by another classification unless the operations subject to code 4511 are conducted as a separate and distinct business.
(7) Repair operations.
Risks with shop operations that involve the repair of a product for which there is no repair classification are assigned to the classification that applies to the manufacture of the product, unless this repair work is specifically referred to by another classification, footnote, or definition in the manual.
Example of repair operations that are classified to the manufacturing code:
(a) A pump repair business is assigned to code 3612 (pump mfg.). There is no separate code for pump repair.
(b) A motor repair business is assigned to code 3643 (electric power or transmission equipment mfg.). There is no separate code for motor repair.
(8) Recycling operations.
(a) The collection, sorting and handling of recyclable materials for resale to others must be assigned to the appropriate store or dealer classification, or to the classification that most closely describes the business.
(b) Risks with operations that involve the reuse of materials for the production of a new product must be assigned to the classification that applies to the manufacture of the product unless such work is specifically referred to another classification, footnote, or definition in the manual.
(E) Payroll assignment: miscellaneous employees.
(1) Miscellaneous employees who perform duties that are commonly conducted for separate operations that are subject to more than one basic classification must be assigned to the governing classification.
(2) Miscellaneous employees include general superintendents (other than construction superintendents), maintenance or power plant employees, shipping or receiving clerks, and yard workers (other than construction).
Refer to paragraph (D)(5) of this rule if the governing classification is a standard exception.
Example of classification for miscellaneous employees:
The insured has two separate operations, a machine shop (code 3632) on one floor of the building and a plastics manufacturing business (code 4452) on another floor. If it is determined that code 3632 is the governing classification, all elevator operators, porters, cleaners, superintendents, and shipping clerks serving both operations are assigned to code 3632.
(F) Payroll assignment: interchange of labor.
Some employees may perform duties directly related to more than one properly assigned classification according to paragraph (D)(3) of this rule. Their payroll may be divided among the properly assigned classifications provided that:
(1) The classifications can be properly assigned to the employer according to the rules of the classification system, and
(2) The employer maintains proper payroll records, which show the actual payroll by classification for that individual employee.
(a) Records must reflect actual time spent working within each job classification and an average hourly wage comparable to the wage rates for such employees within the employer's industry.
(b) Estimated or percentage allocation of payroll is not permitted.
Note: if payroll records do not show the actual payroll applicable to each classification, the entire payroll of the individual employee must be assigned to the highest rated classification that represents any part of his or her work.
(3) Payroll for holiday, vacation, sick pay, overtime and all other forms of payroll that are not directly attributable to a specific classification code must be allocated to the classification code with the greatest amount of payroll applicable to the individual employee.
If none of the classification codes applicable to the employee has the greatest amount of payroll, the payroll for holiday, vacation sick pay, overtime and all other forms of payroll that are not directly attributable to a specific classification code must be allocated to the highest rated classification code applicable to the employee.
(4) Some employees qualify for division of payroll between two or more basic classification codes and also engage in operations that are classified by codes 8810, 8742, 8748 or 8871. The payroll for these standard exception operations must be allocated to the basic classification code with the largest amount of payroll applicable to that employee.
Exceptions:
Code 8810 (clerical office employees), code 8871 (clerical telecommuter employees), code 8742 (salespersons, collectors, or messengers-outside) and code 8748 (automobile salespersons) are not available for division of payroll under this rule. However, when an interchange of labor exists between code 8810 and code 8871:
(a) Code 8871 will be assigned when the employee spends more than fifty per cent of the time worked telecommuting as described by paragraph (B)(2)(a)(ii)(c) of this rule.
(b) Code 8810 will be assigned when the employee spends fifty per cent or less of the time worked telecommuting as described by paragraph (B)(2)(a)(ii)(c) of this rule.
The distribution of payroll for the employee may result in no single basic classification code that represents the largest amount of that employee's payroll. In such cases, the payroll included in the standard exception codes (8810, 8742, 8748 and 8871) will be assigned to the highest rated classification code that represents any part of the employee's work.
This rule does not apply to miscellaneous employees. Refer to paragraph (E) of this rule for these employees.
Examples of instances of interchange of labor where an employee's payroll may be divided between two or more classifications:
(i) In a business that manufactures clocks, all employees must be assigned to either code 3385 (clock mfg.), code 8810 (clerical), code 8742 (salespersons-outside), or code 7380 (drivers). In this example, division of payroll is only allowed for employees whose work is divided between activities described by codes 3385 and 7380. Codes 8810 and 8742 are not eligible for division of payroll.
(ii) In a business that sells furniture, all employees must be assigned to either code 8044 (store: furniture & drivers), code 8810 (clerical), or code 8742 (salespersons-outside). No division of payroll is allowed in this example, since drivers are already included in the basic classifications. Codes 8810 and 8742 are not eligible for division of payroll.
(iii) In a business that manufactures paper and also further processes this paper into wallpaper, all employees must be assigned to either code 4239 (paper mfg.), code 4279 (wallpaper mfg.), code 8810 (clerical), code 8742 (salespersons-outside), or code 7380 (drivers). A division of payroll is allowed for employees whose work is divided among activities described by codes 4239, 4279, and 7380. Codes 8810 and 8742 are not eligible for division of payroll.

4123-17-10 Excess premiums.
The administrator of workers' compensation, with the advice and consent of the bureau of workers' compensation board of directors, has authority to approve contributions made to the state insurance fund by employers pursuant to sections 4121.121, 4123.29, 4123.32, and 4123.34 of the Revised Code. Pursuant to sections 4123.29 and 4123.34 of the Revised Code, the administrator is required to keep premiums at the lowest level consistent with the maintenance of a solvent state insurance fund and of a reasonable surplus. Pursuant to section 4123.32.1 of the Revised Code, in the event there is developed as of any given rate revision date a surplus of earned premium over all losses which, in the judgment of the bureau of workers' compensation board of directors, is larger than is necessary adequately to safeguard the solvency of the fund, the bureau of workers' compensation board of directors may return such excess surplus to the subscriber to the fund in either the form of cash refunds or a reduction of premiums, regardless of when the premium obligation has accrued. The bureau of workers' compensation board of directors shall have the discretion and authority to determine whether there is an excess surplus of premium; whether to return the excess surplus to employers; the nature of the cash refunds or reduction of premiums; the employers who are subscribers to the state insurance fund who are eligible for the cash refunds or reduction of premiums; the payroll period or periods for which a reduction of premium has accrued and the premium payment for which the reduction of premium applies; the applicable date of the cash refunds or reduction of premiums; and any other issues involving cash refunds or reduction of premiums due to an excess surplus of earned premium.

===================================================================



 

4123-17-13 Employer application for workers' compensation coverage.
(A) To institute workers' compensation coverage under this rule, the employer shall submit an application for coverage that completely provides all the information required for the bureau of workers' compensation to establish coverage for the employer.
(1) The application for coverage shall be submitted on a form designated by the bureau, and shall include, at a minimum, the following information:
(a) The legal name and business entity type (corporation, L.L.C., sole proprietorship, partnership, etc.);
(b) Address of the employer;
(c) The federal tax identification number or social security number of the employer;
(d) Information related to the description of the employer's operations, including:
(i) A description of the work done or industry conducted by the employer, and
(ii) The estimated average number of employees in each kind of work; and
(iii) The estimated wages of employees in each kind of work over the next twelve months.
(e) Information related to whether the applicant for coverage has purchased an existing business or has another associated policy;
(f) Name of the owners or corporate officers, and, where applicable for elective coverage, the name and necessary identifying information of the sole proprietor, partners, or ministers;
(g) Signature of the person completing the application for coverage; and
(h) A non-refundable application fee equal to the minimum administrative annual charge set forth in rule 4123-17-26 of the Administrative Code.
(2) If the bureau receives an application for coverage that does not contain all of the information required by paragraph (A)(1) of this rule, the bureau will attempt to contact the employer to obtain the required information. If the applicant does not provide the required information, the bureau shall deny the employer's application for coverage based upon the employer's failure to provide all the information required by paragraph (A)(1) of this rule.
(3) When an applicant fails to provide the information required by paragraph (A)(1) of this rule and has employed one or more persons, the employer may be considered a non-complying employer under rule 4123-14-01 of the Administrative Code, and the bureau may recover premium and penalties from the employer under rule 4123-14-02 of the Administrative Code.
(B) Upon receipt of the application, the bureau shall assign payroll to the classification applicable to the duties performed. The bureau shall send the employer notice of its determination regarding the employer's manual classifications and division of the employer's payroll within those classifications, the manual rates for those classifications, and estimated premium due for the remainder of the policy year in which the employer applies for initial coverage.
(C) If the bureau determines, after reviewing the information submitted with the application provided for in paragraph (A) of this rule, that the employer was subject to division (B)(2) of section 4123.01 of the Revised Code but failed to comply with the law in matters of workers' compensation coverage, the bureau shall notify the employer in writing of such a finding and request any additional information required to make a determination of the period for which the employer was not in compliance with the law. Upon such determination, the bureau shall notify the employer of the premium and assessments due for the period of noncompliance.
(D) If the bureau determines, after reviewing the information submitted with the application provided for in paragraph (A) of this rule, that the employer is essentially the same employer regardless of entity type for which risk coverage previously had been provided, the bureau may transfer the prior risk coverage to the employer pursuant to rule 4123-17-02 of the Administrative Code and the employer shall assume any outstanding obligations under the prior risk coverage. The bureau may reactivate a previously cancelled policy in order to complete this transfer.
(E) Upon receipt of the application fee, the bureau shall issue a notice of workers' compensation coverage pursuant to section 4123.82 of the Revised Code. The notice shall indicate that coverage is contingent on payment of estimated premium and assessments due.
(F) Upon receipt of the first estimated premium payment, the employer's coverage shall begin.
(1) Such coverage shall be effective from the date of receipt of the application for coverage required by paragraph (A) of this rule.

(B) All books, records, papers, and documents reflecting upon the amount and the classifications of the payroll expenditures of an employer shall be kept available for inspection at any time by the bureau of workers' compensation or any of its assistants, agents, representatives or employees. If any employer fails to keep, preserve and maintain such records and other information reflecting upon payroll expenditures, or fails to make such records and information available for inspection, or fails to furnish the bureau or any of its assistants, agents, representatives or employees, full and complete information in reference to expenditures for payroll when such information is requested, the bureau may determine upon such information as is available to it the amount of premium due from the employer and its findings shall constitute prima facie evidence of the amount of premium due from the employer.

===================================================================



 

4123-17-28 Correction of inaccuracies affecting employer's premium rates.
(A) Whenever the bureau of workers' compensation detects an inaccuracy in the recording or processing of data, records, payroll, claims, or other pertinent items affecting the risk's status, merit-rated modification or premium, such discrepancy shall be corrected. This correction shall be accomplished regardless of whether this entails increasing or decreasing the risk's merit-rated modification or premium rate. The risk or its representative will be advised of any correction and the effect thereof made under the authority of this rule.
(B) Any correction made pursuant to the provisions of paragraph (A) of this rule shall be applied to the current rating year, the rating year immediately proceding the current rating year, and to all rating years subsequent to the current rating years as of the date on which the error was discovered by the bureau or reported to the bureau, whichever date is earlier, except in matters involving handicap reimbursement and service-connected disabilities and cases covered by rules 4123-17-02, 4123-17-17, and 4123-19-03 of the Administrative Code. In cases where two or more employers may be affected by such correction, the same period of adjustment will be applied to all affected employers.
(C) Notwithstanding paragraphs (A) and (B) of this rule or paragraphs (C) and (D) of rule 4123-17-17 of the Administrative Code, the bureau may adjust the employer's account or experience for a period in excess of twenty-four months immediately prior to the beginning of the current payroll reporting period for the following circumstances:
(1) If the bureau determines that the employer misrepresented payroll or failed to submit payroll for any period, the bureau may adjust the employer's account or experience resulting in an increase in any amount of premium above the amount of contributions made by the employer to the fund for the entire period the employer misrepresented payroll or the entire period the employer failed to submit payroll, regardless of when the misrepresentation of payroll or failure to submit payroll occurred.
(2) If the bureau excluded any claim costs from the employer's account or experience because the costs were subject to an appeal to court under section 4123.512 of the Revised Code and by a final adjudication it is determined that the claim costs shall be charged to the claim, the bureau may adjust the employer's account or experience resulting in an increase in any amount of premium above the amount of contributions made by the employer to the fund for the entire period affected by the addition of the claim costs to the employer's account or experience.

===================================================================



 

4123-17-32 Self-insuring employer assessment based upon paid compensation.
The administrator of workers' compensation, with the advice and consent of the bureau of workers' compensation board of directors, has authority to determine and levy against self-insuring employers amounts to be paid to support the safety and hygiene fund, the administrative cost fund, the portion of the surplus fund that is mandatory, the portion of the surplus fund that is used for rehabilitation reimbursement subject to the self-insuring employer's election under section 4121.66 of the Revised Code, the portion of surplus fund that is used for handicap reimbursement subject to the self-insuring employer's election under section 4123.343 of the Revised Code, and the portion of the surplus fund used for claims reimbursement for self-insuring employers under division (H) of section 4123.512 of the Revised Code, pursuant to sections 4121.12, 4121.37, 4121.66, 4123.34 , 4123.342, and 4123.35 of the Revised Code in conjunction with rule 4123-19-01 of the Administrative Code. The administrator hereby sets the self-insuring employer assessments to be effective July 1, 2016, for the period July 1, 2016, to June 30, 2017, payable in two equal remittances by February 28, 2017, and August 31, 2017, as follows:
(A) The assessments shall be on the basis of the paid compensation attributable to the individual self-insuring employer as a fraction of the total amount of paid compensation for the previous calendar year attributable to all amenable self-insuring employers.
(B) Paid compensation means all amounts paid by a self-insuring employer for living maintenance benefits, all amounts for compensation paid pursuant to sections 4121.63, 4121.67, 4123.56, 4123.57, 4123.58, 4123.59, 4123.60 and 4123.64 of the Revised Code, all amounts paid as wages in lieu of such compensation, all amounts paid in lieu of such compensation under a non-occupational accident and sickness program fully funded by the self-insuring employer, and all amounts paid by a self-insuring employer for a violation of a specific safety standard pursuant to section 35 of article II, Ohio Constitution and section 4121.47 of the Revised Code. Any reimbursement received from the surplus fund pursuant to section 4123.512 of the Revised Code by a self-insuring employer for any such payments or compensation paid shall be applied to reduce the amount of paid compensation reported in the year in which the reimbursement is made. Any amount recovered by the self-insuring employer under section 4123.931 of the Revised Code and any amount that is determined not to have been payable to a claimant in any final administrative or judicial proceeding shall be deducted, in the year collected, from the amount of paid compensation reported.
(C) The assessments shall be computed for all self-insuring employers operating in Ohio by multiplying the following rates by the individual self-insuring employer's paid compensation for calendar year 2015:
(1) Safety and hygiene fund: 0.0030.
(2) Administrative cost fund, BWC: 0.0893.
(3) Administrative cost fund, IC: 0.0668.
(4) Surplus fund (mandatory): 0.0600.
(D) The assessment to fund the portion of the surplus fund that is used for claims reimbursement for all self-insuring employers operating in Ohio who have not made an election to opt out of the right to reimbursement under the provisions of division (H) of section 4123.512 of the Revised Code shall be computed by multiplying the following rate by the individual self-insuring employer's paid compensation for calendar year 2015:
Surplus fund (disallowed claims reimbursement): 0.0380.
(E) An employer who no longer is a self-insuring employer in Ohio or who no longer is operating in this state shall continue to pay assessments for administrative costs and for the portion of the surplus fund that is mandatory. The assessments shall be computed by such employer by multiplying the following rates by the individual employer's paid compensation for calendar year 2015:
(1) Administrative cost fund, BWC: 0.0893.
(2) Administrative cost fund, IC: 0.0668.
(3) Surplus fund (mandatory): 0.0600.
(F) If the paid compensation for a self-insuring employer for calendar year 2015 is less than thirteen thousand six hundred ninety-two dollars and thirty-eight cents, the minimum assessments shall be paid as follows:
(1) Safety and hygiene fund: $ 41.08.
(2) Administrative cost fund, BWC: $1, 222.73.
(3) Administrative cost fund, IC: $ 914.65.
(4) Surplus fund (mandatory): $ 821.54.
An employer who no longer is a self-insuring employer in Ohio or no longer is operating in this state and who has less than thirteen thousand six hundred ninety-two dollars and thirty-eight cents in paid compensation for calendar year 2015 shall have a reduced minimum assessment. The minimum assessment shall be ninety per cent of the above minimum assessments in this paragraph in the year after becoming inactive, eighty per cent in the following year, seventy per cent in the following year, and so forth, being reduced ten per cent each year, until the assessment is phased out over ten years. The bureau may, in its discretion, permit an employer to pay its total assessment obligation under this paragraph in a single payment, discounted for present value at a rate determined by the bureau. An employer electing to pay its assessment obligations in a single payment must continue to administer self-insured claims and pay compensation and benefits pursuant to paragraph (C) of rule 4123-19-05 of the Administrative Code.
(G) If an individual self-insuring employer has become self-insured in the last five years (on or after July 1, 2011) paid compensation shall be as defined in paragraph (B) of this rule and shall additionally include compensation paid in calendar year 2015 by the state insurance fund for claim costs directly attributable to the employer prior to becoming self-insured.
(H) The initial assessment to a self-insuring employer in its first calendar year of operation as a self-insuring employer shall be prorated to cover the time period that self-insurance was in effect, but shall not be less than the minimum assessment for a self-insuring employer as provided in paragraph (F) of this rule.
(I) Pursuant to rule 4123-19-15 of the Administrative Code, the following assessment, to be billed and payable in two equal remittances by February 28, 2017, and August 31, 2017, shall be computed for all self-insuring employers by multiplying the following rate by the individual self-insuring employer's paid compensation for calendar year 2015:
Self-insuring employer guaranty fund: 0.0950.
(J) If an employer fails to pay the assessment when due, the administrator may add a late fee penalty of not more than five hundred dollars to the assessment plus an additional penalty amount as follows:
(1) For an assessment from sixty-one to ninety days past due, the prime interest rate, multiplied by the assessment due;
(2) For assessment from ninety-one to one hundred twenty days past due, the prime interest rate plus two per cent, multiplied by the assessment due;
(3) For an assessment from one hundred twenty-one to one hundred fifty days past due, the prime interest rate plus four per cent, multiplied by the assessment due;
(4) For an assessment from one hundred fifty-one to one hundred eighty days past due, the prime interest rate plus six per cent, multiplied by the assessment due;
(5) For an assessment from one hundred eighty-one to two hundred ten days past due, the prime interest rate plus eight per cent, multiplied by the assessment due;
(6) For each additional thirty-day period or portion thereof that an assessment remains past due after it has remained past due for more than two hundred ten days, the prime interest rate plus eight per cent, multiplied by the assessment due.
For purposes of this paragraph, "prime interest rate" means the average bank prime rate, and the administrator shall determine the prime interest rate in the same manner as a county auditor determines the average bank prime rate under section 929.02 of the Revised Code.

(a) All LSS payments will be treated the same whether the result of a court-ordered settlement, an agency-negotiated settlement or any other type of settlement.
(b) Once a PES agency begins participating in the LSS direct reimbursement and rating program, all LSS payments will be excluded from the losses used to calculate the contribution rate for future policy years.
(c) When an agency terminates a LSS direct reimbursement and rating program, the contribution rate will include all LSS payments that were made by the bureau and not reimbursed by the PES agency.
(3) LSS reimburseemnt payments.
(a) A LSS will be billed in the next month following the date the LSS warrant was cashed.
(b) The bureau will bill a structured settlement to the PES agency as the warrant is cashed.
(c) The PES agency shall pay the LSS monthly bill within thirty days of the billing date.
(d) If the PES agency fails to pay a LSS monthly bill within thirty days, the bureau will remove the PES agency from the LSS direct reimbursement rating and payment program and the bureau will include the outstanding LSS payments in the rate calculation.
(e) A PES agency may settle permanent total disability (PTD) and death benefit claims in which the present value was previously used in the rate calculations.
PES agencies will not be billed for the settlement costs of PTD and death benefit claims in which the present value of both medical and indemnity costs was included in contribution rate calculations. These claims would likely be death benefit claims awarded before January 1, 2001 and PTD claims awarded before January 1, 1996.
For PTD claims awarded between January 1, 1996 and December 31, 2000 and where the present value of the future indemnity cost was previously included in the development of the agency's contribution rates, the bureau will include only the medical portion of the settlement amount in the quarterly billings.
(f) A PES agency shall file any dispute in writing, specifying the agency's objections to the billing, with the bureau's direct billing department. The filing of a dispute does not relieve or suspend the agency's obligation to pay the obligation. Questions concerning the rate calculations should be directed to the bureau's actuarial division.
(4) Change in status.
(a) When a PES agency combines with another PES agency, the succeeding agency's participation in this program will not be affected.
(b) A PES agency that is participating in a program and transfers a portion of its operations to another agency shall continue to participate in the program. Participation in this program by the agency to which the operations were transferred will not be affected.
(c) Where a PES agency participating in a LSS direct reimbursement rating and payment program becomes self-insured, the bureau will calculate a buyout and any obligations owed by the PES agency under the program will be included in the buyout.
(B) Terminating a LSS program.
(1) A PES agency may request, in writing, to terminate a LSS program after the three year minimum commitment period has been completed. The agency's participation in the program will automatically be renewed for another three years unless the written request is submitted.
(2) A PES agency shall submit a request to terminate a program before the first day of the second month of the quarter the three year commitment ends. For example, if the PES agency started participating in the LSS program or its participation was renewed for the policy year beginning July 1, 2013, the request must be submitted before May 1, 2016.
(3) Once a PES agency terminates a LSS program, the agency is no longer eligible to participate in this program.

4123-17-42 Eligibility for retrospective rating.
(A) An employer that is either a private or a public employer taxing district as defined in division (B)(1) of section 4123.01 of the Revised Code may be eligible for either the tier I or tier II retrospective rating plan depending upon satisfying the eligibility requirements for either the tier I or tier II retrospective rating plan as described in this rule.

(2) The employer cannot have cumulative lapses in workers' compensation coverage in excess of fifteen days within the last five rating years.
(3) The employer must report actual payroll for the preceding policy year and pay any premium due upon reconciliation of estimated premium and actual premium for that policy year no later than the date set forth in rule 4123-17-14 of the Administrative Code.

(E) In addition to the requirements of paragraph (B) of this rule, for the tier II retrospective rating plan, a private employer must submit audited financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). A public employer must submit audited or reviewed financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP or other comprehensive basis of accounting as permitted in Ohio auditor of state bulletin 2005-002.
For a private employer that does not demonstrate the ability to satisfy the financial criteria of paragraph (C) of this rule or a public employer that does not demonstrate the ability to satisfy the financial criteria of paragraph (D) of this rule, the financial statements provided by the employer must demonstrate the ability to sustain losses that are at the maximum claim limit for the retrospective rating plan and still maintain its financial viability.

===================================================================



 

4123-17-51 Termination and transfers.
(A) A risk may not retroactively include claims experience in a plan, exclude claims experience from a plan nor voluntarily terminate a plan during the evaluation period.
(B) Successor: retrospective-rated Predecessor: experience-rated, base-rated, non-complying or self-insured
Where one legal entity that has established coverage and is a retrospective-rated employer wholly succeeds one or more legal entities having established coverage and the predecessor entities are either experience-rated, base-rated, non-complying or self-insured at the date of succession, the costs incurred and payroll reported by the predecessor from the date of succession to the end of the policy year, shall be included in the successor's retrospective rating plan. The successor remains liable for any and all charges associated with the predecessor. If the predecessor had at any time participated in a retrospective policy plan, the successor remains liable for any and all charges associated with the retrospective policy plans. The adjustment for combinations in the experience rating system will follow the same rules that are in effect as of the date of succession.
(C) Successor: self-insured Predecessor: retrospective-rated
Where one legal entity that has established coverage and is a self-insured employer wholly succeeds one or more entities that are retrospective-rated, the retrospective-rated predecessor's plan(s) shall terminate as of the ending date of the evaluation period. Payroll reported and claims incurred on or after the date of succession will be the responsibility of the successor. The successor shall remain responsible for all liabilities of the predecessor, including but not limited to costs associated with any retrospective policy years still in the evaluation period. The minimum premium for the current policy year will be based upon the predecessor's annualized payroll.
(D) Successor: experience-rated or base-rated Predecessor: retrospective-rated
Where one legal entity that has established coverage and is an experience-rated or based-rated employer wholly succeeds one or more entities that are retrospective-rated, the retrospective-rated predecessor's plan(s) shall terminate as of the ending date of the evaluation period. Payroll reported and claims incurred on or after the date of succession will be the responsibility of the successor under its experience rated plan. The successor shall remain responsible for all liabilities of the predecessor, including but not limited to costs associated with any retrospective policy years still in the evaluation period. The minimum premium for the current policy year will be based upon the predecessor's annualized payroll.
(E) Successor: retrospective-rated Predecessor: retrospective-rated
If the successor and the predecessor are retrospective-rated employers for the current policy year, the successor shall be retrospective-rated based on the combined experience of the predecessor and the successor. The successor remains liable for any and all retrospective-rated premiums or other charges associated with the predecessor. The adjustment for combinations in the experience rating system will follow the same rules that are in effect as of the date of succession.
(F) Successor: entity not having coverage Predecessor: retrospective-rated
When an entity not having coverage wholly succeeds a retrospective-rated entity, the experience of the predecessor shall be transferred to the successor-employer effective as of the actual date of succession. The successor remains liable for any and all open retrospective-rated premium or other charges associated with the predecessor. The successor entity will become retrospective-rated as of the date of succession until the end of the policy year, with the same plan parameters chosen by the predecessor risk. The adjustment for combinations in the experience rating system will follow the same rules that are in effect as of the date of succession.
(G) Successor: cancels coverage Predecessor: no predecessor
If a current or previously retrospective-rated employer cancels coverage and does not transfer or combine operations with another entity, all open retrospective policy years will be terminated as of the date of cancellation. If the employer was retrospective-rated during the two most recent rating years, the final premium for each of those years will be the maximum premium for the plan selected by the employer. The maximum premium for the current year will be based upon the employer's annualized payroll. If the employer was retrospective-rated in other years of the evaluation period, the final premium for each of those years will be calculated as stated in rule 4123-17-47 of the Administrative Code.
(H) Successor: files a petition for bankruptcy Predecessor: no predecessor
If a current or previously retrospective-rated employer with open policy year(s) files a petition for bankruptcy under chapter 7 or chapter 11 of the Federal Bankruptcy Law, that employer shall notify the bureau of workers' compensation law section by certified mail within five working days from the date of the bankruptcy filing. The bureau will petition the bankruptcy court to take appropriate action to protect the health of the state insurance fund and other related funds.
(I) Successor and/or predecessor: open retrospective-rated policy years in the evaluation period.
If the successor and predecessor employers are not currently retrospective-rated but either or both have open retrospective-rated policy years in the evaluation period, the successor shall be liable for any and all retrospective-rated premiums or other charges associated with the predecessor. The adjustment for combinations in the experience rating system will follow the same rules that are currently being used.
(J) Partial transfer
If an entity partially succeeds another entity and the predecessor entity has any retrospective policy years in the evaluation period, the predecessor entity remains liable for all premium associated with claims incurred prior to the date of the partial transfer. If the financial capability of the predecessor entity is not sufficient to cover the costs of the retrospective rating plan, the successor shall be liable for all unpaid costs of the predecessor's retrospective rating plan through closure. If the successor is retrospective-rated in the current policy year and the effective date of the partial transfer is other than the beginning of the rating year, the successor will continue to be rated in the same manner as prior to the transfer. The successor will be liable for any payroll and/or claims incurred from that part of the predecessor entity which was transferred, beginning on the date of the transfer. If the successor has retrospective policy years in the evaluation period, the successor remains liable for all charges associated with retrospective rating plan(s), whether or not the successor is retrospective rated as of the effective date of the partial transfer. The adjustment for partial transfers in the experience rating system will follow the same rules that are in effect as of the date of succession.
(K) Transfer or sale of assets only
In the case of the transfer or sale of assets without transfer of liability or stock, the transferor who is now retrospective-rated or has been retrospective-rated with policy year(s) still in the evaluation period shall notify the Ohio bureau of workers' compensation actuarial section by certified mail within five working days of the date of transfer. The bureau shall schedule and hold a hearing within sixty days of such notification, or in the event of no notification, within sixty days of receiving information which indicates such a transfer may have occurred. At this hearing the bureau shall determine and set responsibility for funding the as yet unpaid costs associated with the retrospective policy year(s) still in the evaluation period.

--->ohio--->Ohio Rules--->Chapter 4123: Bureau of Workers' Compensation--->Chapter 4123-17 General Rating for the State Insurance Fund--->4123-17-52 Parameters of the retrospective rating plan.
===================================================================



 

4123-17-52 Parameters of the retrospective rating plan.
(A) An employer participating in retrospective rating will pay the following:
(1) Minimum premium. The minimum premium depends on the assigned hazard group, the per claim limit selected by the employer, the maximum premium limit selected by the employer, and the employer's base-rated premium or experience-rated premium. The employer's base-rated premium or experience-rated premium is assumed to be at least the minimum experience-rated/base-rated premium threshold listed on the "retrospective rating minimum premium percentages table". The minimum premium includes employer contributions to cover safety and hygiene costs, surplus costs, and the cost of losses exceeding the per claim and the maximum premium limitations and those health partnership program costs associated with the losses exceeding the per claim and the maximum premium limitations.
(2) Premium based on paid losses. The employer will pay for any compensation payments, including death and permanent total disability, and medical payments made in covered claims. Billings to the employer will be sent annually for ten years to collect for these medical and compensation payments.
(3) Premium based on claim reserves. The employer will pay the value of reserves on claims evaluated as of the end of the tenth year.
(4) Premium for health partnership program costs on retained losses. In each evaluation period associated with a policy year, the employer will pay an additional premium based a percentage (loss conversion factor) applied to the paid losses and the premium based on reserves to cover the associated health partnership program costs of those paid losses or reserves. Each policy year will have a specific loss conversion factor, determined before the start of the policy year, which will apply for the ten year retrospective period.
(B) Surplus charges in claims will not be charged to the employer.
(C) Individual claims costs will be limited to the per claim limit selected by the employer.
The usual experience rating limitations will not apply.
(D) The employer's maximum premium will be limited to a percentage of its base-rated or experience-rated premium as selected by the employer. That is, premiums based on losses , reserves and health partnership program costs charged to the employer cannot exceed the maximum premium minus the minimum premium.
(E) The premium for health partnership program costs on retained losses is an aggregate calculation made on the total billings to an employer for either paid losses or reserves. As such, premiums associated with health partnership program costs are not allocated to individual claims, and therefore are not considered when evaluating whether an individual claim has reached the per claim limit.
(F) When an employer leaves a retrospective rating program and returns to the state fund program, the employer shall be subject to all of the provisions of rule 4123-17-03 of the Administrative Code, classification rates.
(G) An employer removed from retrospective rating for failure to comply with paragraph (B) of rule 4123-17-42 of the Administrative Code will be required to pay:
(1) Claims costs according to this rule for all injuries incurred from the beginning of the policy year in which the employer participated in retrospective rating through the date of removal from the program.
(2) Full experience-rated premium from the date of removal from retrospective rating through the remainder of the policy year.

--->ohio--->Ohio Rules--->Chapter 4123: Bureau of Workers' Compensation--->Chapter 4123-17 General Rating for the State Insurance Fund--->4123-17-59 Fifteen thousand dollar medical-only program.
===================================================================



 

4123-17-59 Fifteen thousand dollar medical-only program.
(A) Any employer who is paying premiums to the state insurance fund and whose coverage is in force may elect to participate in the fifteen thousand dollar medical-only program as provided in section 4123.29 of the Revised Code. No formal application is required; however, an employer must elect to participate by telephoning the bureau. Once an employer has elected to participate in the program, the employer will be responsible for all bills in all medical-only claims with a date of injury the same or later than the election date and the employer agrees to pay bills within thirty days of receipt of the bill, unless the employer notifies the bureau within fourteen days of receipt of the notification of a claim being filed that it does not wish to pay the bills in that claim, or the employer notifies the bureau that the fifteen thousand dollar maximum has been paid, or the employer notifies the bureau of the last day of service on which it will be responsible for the bills in a particular medical-only claim.
(B) Employers may pay bills only on any alleged medical-only injury. The provisions of this program and rule shall not apply to claims in which an employer with knowledge of a claimed compensable injury or occupational disease, has paid wages in lieu of compensation or total disability. Payment of a bill by an employer does not waive the bureau's right to adjudicate the claim, nor does it waive the employer's right to contest the claim should a claim be filed.
(C) This program in no way supersedes the right of any injured worker to file a workers' compensation claim with the bureau.
(D) An employer or its agent may elect to pay to the injured worker or the provider on behalf of the injured worker the first fifteen thousand dollars of a medical-only claim. Employers may elect which medical-only claims they do not wish to cover under this program.
(1) An employer electing to pay bills in its employees' medical-only claims is responsible for all bills in a claim until the fifteen thousand dollar maximum is reached and the employer provides notice to the bureau that the employer has paid the first fifteen thousand dollars of the bills in the claim by providing the bureau the date of service of the bill which reached the fifteen thousand dollar maximum, or the employer provides notice to the bureau that it no longer wishes to be responsible for the bills in a particular claim by providing the bureau the last date of service that it will pay. The bureau will process all related bills received after the withdrawal notification date.
(2) If the fifteen thousand dollar maximum has not been reached and the payment of a bill will exceed the fifteen thousand dollar maximum, the employer should pay that portion of the bill that will bring the payment to the fifteen thousand dollar maximum and inform the provider to bill the bureau for the remainder of the bill. The employer should then notify the bureau that the first fifteen thousand dollars has been paid, and provide proof of such payment and copies of all bills paid, in the proper billing format, to the bureau. The bureau will then be responsible for processing all future bills.
(3) The employer cannot elect to pay only certain bills for a claim and submit other bills in that claim to the bureau for payment.
(4) Once an employer has elected to pay bills in medical-only claims under this program, the employer must pay all bills under this program within thirty days of receipt of the bill. The employer shall provide copies of the bills paid in the claim, in the proper billing format, to the bureau and the injured worker or the injured worker's representative upon request. Upon written request from the bureau, the employer shall provide documentation to the bureau of all medical-only bills that they are paying directly. Such requests from the bureau may not be made more frequently than on a semiannual basis. Failure to provide such documentation to the bureau within thirty days of receipt of the request may result in the employer's forfeiture of participation in the program for such injury.
(E) An employer electing this program must keep a record of the injury to include: name, address, and social security number of the injured worker; date and time of injury; type of injury; part of body injured; and a brief description of the accident. The employer also shall keep a copy of all bills with proof and date of payment under this program. This information will be made available to the bureau and the injured worker or their representative upon request. The information must be kept on file for five years from the last date a bill has been paid by the employer or the information has been received by the bureau.
(1) An employer in the program must notify the bureau within fourteen days of a claim being filed of the employer's intention not to cover the first fifteen thousand dollars of the medical costs of the claim. This notification may be by telephone or in writing.
(2) The bureau will process all related bills in a filed medical-only claim in the normal manner unless the employer has previously notified the bureau that it has elected to participate in the fifteen thousand dollar program.
(3) In those cases in which the bureau has been properly notified by the employer of the employer's intention to directly pay the bills, the bureau shall not pay any bills submitted to the bureau directly from the provider but will notify the provider that the bill should be submitted to the employer until the provider is notified by the employer that the bureau is responsible for the bills in the claim. No interest shall be paid by the bureau on account of bills not paid within thirty days if such bills are the responsibility of the employer.
(4) All bills submitted to the bureau or the employer for payment must be in the proper billing format and must be received by the bureau or the employer within one year of the date of service on the bill.
(F) An employer electing this program has the responsibility to notify the injured worker and medical provider, in writing, of the acknowledgment of the alleged medical-only injury, that it has elected under section 4123.29 of the Revised Code to pay the first fifteen thousand dollars, that all bills should be submitted to the employer, and that the injured worker and the bureau should not be billed.
(1) Once an employer in this program pays a bill on a work-related injury the bureau will not reimburse that employer.
(2) In the event that a duplicate payment is made, it will be the employer's responsibility to seek reimbursement from the provider. The employer may request reimbursement of such bills from the provider, and the provider shall reimburse the employer where the bureau has paid the bill.
(3) In the event that a medical-only claim changes to a lost time claim, the bureau will not reimburse the employer for bills that have been paid by the employer under this program.
(G) The employer shall pay all bills as billed or agree upon an appropriate reimbursement level with the provider for claims with a date of injury prior to June 30, 2009. Providers must accept the bureau fee schedule as payment in full for claims with a date of injury on or after June 30, 2009. A certified health care provider shall extend to an employer who participates in this program the same rates for services rendered to an employee of that employer as the provider bills the administrator for the same type of medical claim processed by the bureau and shall not charge, assess, or otherwise attempt to collect from an employee any amount for covered services or supplies that is in excess of that rate. Providers may only balance bill the bureau on the occasion of a bill that would require an employer to exceed the fifteen thousand dollar maximum. The bureau will not mediate fee disputes between the employer and the provider. If an employer elects to enter the program and the employer fails to pay a bill for a medical-only claim included in the program, the employer shall be liable for that bill and the employee for whom the employer failed to pay the bill shall not be liable for that bill.
(H) Payments made by the employer in this program will not be charged to that employer's experience modification; however, if a claim has been filed with the bureau and bills paid by the bureau, these payments will be included in the employer's experience modification. The bureau will not adjust the employer's experience modification to remove such payments unless the employer has complied with this rule and the bureau has made such payments in contravention of this rule. Failure by an employer to make timely payments on all bills will not affect the coverage of that employer and will not obligate the bureau to pay interest to the medical provider; however, the bureau may exclude employers who do not make timely payment on all bills in this program from participation in this program. An employer may appeal a decision of the bureau excluding the employer from this program to the adjudicating committee under rule 4123-14-06 of the Administrative Code.
(I) An employer who elects to participate in this program may cancel its participation in the program at any time by telephoning the bureau. The bureau will process all related bills in all medical-only claims against that employer's account after the date of the telephone call.

--->ohio--->Ohio Rules--->Chapter 4123: Bureau of Workers' Compensation--->Chapter 4123-17 General Rating for the State Insurance Fund--->4123-17-61 Criteria for group experience rating.
===================================================================



 

4123-17-61 Criteria for group experience rating.
(A) The administrator shall offer a plan that groups employers for rating purposes. Employers shall retain their separate risk identity, but shall be pooled and grouped for rating purposes only, specifically with respect to experience rating.
(B) In establishing a group for group rating purposes, the sponsoring group organization or individual employers in the group must satisfy all of the following requirements and must meet all the sponsorship rules as provided in rule 4123-17-61.1 of the Administrative Code:
(1) All of the employers within the group must be governing members of the sponsoring organization or the affiliate organization.
(2) The employer must have a policy in good standing with the bureau. "Policy in good standing" means the employer is current on all payments due to the bureau and is in compliance with bureau laws, rules, and regulations at the time of enrollment or reenrollment.
(3) The employers' business in the organization must be substantially similar such that the risks which are grouped are substantially homogeneous. A group shall be considered substantially homogeneous if the main operating manual classifications of the risks as determined by the premium obligations for the rating year beginning two years prior to the coverage period are assigned to the same or similar industry groups, as determined by appendix B to rule 4123-17-05 of the Administrative Code. Industry groups seven and nine as well as eight and nine are considered similar.
(a) The bureau may allow an employer to move to a more homogeneous group, after September thirtieth for private employer groups and March thirty-first for pubic employer taxing district groups but before the application deadline for group rating identified in the appendices to rule 4123-17-74 of the Administrative Code, when the employer:
(i) Is an employer without a full year of recorded premium;
(ii) Is reclassified as a result of an audit; or
(iii) Fully or partially combines with another employer.
(b) An individual employer member of a continuing group who initially satisfied the homogeneous requirement shall not be disqualified from participation in the continuing group for failure to continue to satisfy such requirement.
(4) The group of employers must consist of at least one hundred individual members or a group where the aggregate workers' compensation premiums of the members are, as determined by the administrator, expected to exceed one hundred fifty thousand dollars during the policy year for which the application for group rating is made.
(5) As of the deadline for application for group rating set forth in the appendices to rule 4123-17-74 of the Administrative Code, each employer seeking to enroll in a group for workers' compensation coverage must meet the following requirements:
(a) The employer must be current with respect to all payments due the bureau, as defined in paragraph (A)(1)(b) of rule 4123-17-14 of the Administrative Code;
(b) The employer must be current on the payment schedule of any part-pay agreement into which it has entered for payment of premiums or assessment obligations; and
(c) Except as provided for in paragraphs (B)(5)(c)(i) and (B)(5)(c)(ii) of this rule, the employer cannot have cumulative lapses in workers' compensation coverage in excess of forty days within the prior twelve months.
(i) For the policy year commencing July 1, 2015, private employers must not have cumulative lapses in workers' compensation coverage in excess of forty days within the preceding nine months.
(ii) For policy year commencing January 1, 2016, public employer taxing districts must not have cumulative lapses in workers' compensation coverage in excess of forty days within the preceding nine months.
(d) The employer must report actual payroll for the preceding policy year and pay any premium due upon reconciliation of estimated premium and actual premium for that policy year no later than the date set forth in rule 4123-17-14 of the Administrative Code. An employer will be deemed to have met this requirement if the bureau receives the payroll report and the employer pays premium associated with such report before the expiration of any grace period established by the administrator pursuant to paragraph (B) of rule 4123-17-16 of the Administrative Code.
(i) An employer removed from group experience rating for failure to meet this criteria will be rerated for the full policy year at the employer's base-rate or experience-modified rate as determined by their expected losses for the policy year.
(ii) The group shall retain, for the policy year, the experience of any employer removed from group experience rating for failure to meet these criteria.
(6) Cancellations, transfers, and combinations.
(a) An employer whose coverage status becomes cancelled or combined during the rating year may not continue to participate in group rating. The effective date of the removal from the group rating program shall be on the first day of the next policy year, unless the date of cancellation or combination is determined to be the first day of the policy year, in which case the employer shall be removed from group as of the actual date of cancellation or combination. An employer who becomes active and obtains coverage after the group rating application deadline may not participate in group rating for that year except as defined in rule 4123-17-66 of the Administrative Code.
(b) An employer that obtains initial coverage after the group rating application deadline as defined in the appendices to rule 4123-17-74 of the Administrative Code and for which a transfer of experience is indicated under rule 4123-17-02 of the Administrative Code may not participate in group rating for that year except as defined in rule 4123-17-66 of the Administrative Code.
(C) In providing employer group plans under section 4123.29 of the Revised Code, the bureau shall consider an employer group as a single employing entity for purposes of group rating. No employer may be a member of more than one group for the purpose of obtaining workers' compensation coverage.

(h) A copy of the sponsor's safety plan.
(i) With reasonable notice, the bureau may request that a sponsor provide for the bureau's inspection at the sponsor's designated location any of the following: additional financial information, dues structure, revenue sources, a table of organization, a comprehensive membership roster, by-laws, and/or a list of corporate officers.
(F) The sponsoring organization shall provide to the bureau a signed statement certifying the accuracy of the information provided to the bureau. A sponsoring organization's failure to provide accurate information or submission of false information may be grounds for the bureau to refuse to certify the sponsoring organization or to decertify the sponsoring organization. The bureau reserves the authority to use all the listed information above and any other information available to make the certification approval.
(G) Should the bureau deny the certification of the sponsoring organization, the applicant may appeal to the bureau adjudicating committee. After exhausting all administrative appeals and correction of sponsorship requirement deficiencies, the applicant may reapply one year after the latest certification denial.
(H) The bureau will collect this information and retain it or ask that a sponsoring organization maintain the information for bureau inspection upon request.
(I) The sponsoring organization shall be in compliance with all bureau rules. A sponsoring organization's non-compliance may result in decertification.
(J) The sponsoring organization, or their authorized representative, shall have the capability to send and receive secure electronic (FTP - file transfer protocol) files.
(K) Group marketing.
(1) A sponsoring association, affiliate, or representative, including, but not limited to, a third-party administrator, broker, or marketer may not offer a discount to either a private or public employer either seeking to participate in a group-experience rating plan or that exceeds the combined result of the lowest experience modifier and its associated break-even factor for the future policy year until those factors are approved by the bureau's board of directors. Those parties also may not provide marketing material that is either false or unattainable relating to the process of forming groups under the group-retrospective rating plan for a future policy year. Prohibited marketing material under this rule is any communication that:
(a) Instructs prospective participants to provide false information on forms used for purposes of group formation, including the AC-3, the AC-26, and the U-153.
(b) Claims the sponsoring association, affiliate, or representative is endorsed by the bureau or the state of Ohio.
(c) Offers or estimates specific discounts or refunds that are unattainable to prospective participants in either group-experience rating or group-retrospective rating.
(i) For group-experience rating, "unattainable" is defined as exceeding the maximum discount when combining the lowest experience modifier and its associated break-even factors as approved by the bureau of workers' compensation board of directors.
(ii) For group-retrospective rating, "unattainable" is defined as quoting a specific refund amount that exceeds the maximum possible refund when considering the basic premium factor for the maximum premium ratio selected as approved by the bureau of workers' compensation board of directors.
(2) The bureau may apply the following sanctions upon its determination of a violation of this rule:
(a) For a violation of paragraph (K)(1)(c) of this rule the bureau may place that group sponsor at capacity for the an upcoming policy year.
(i) For sponsors that filed group rosters with the bureau for the policy year, "capacity" is defined as prohibiting a sponsoring association from exceeding the total number of employers in their current or most recent groups, adding new employers for groups they may form in the policy year of the sanction, and affiliating with any other group sponsors for the policy year of the sanction.
(ii) For sponsors that have not filed group rosters with the bureau for the current policy year, "capacity" means they will not be able to form groups and cannot affiliate with other group sponsors for the upcoming policy year.
(b) For a violation of paragraph (K)(1)(a) or (K)(1)(b) of this rule, along with any action that results in knowingly falsifying information on forms submitted to the bureau, the bureau shall immediately revoke the sponsor's certification for the upcoming policy year.
(3) The bureau will provide the bureau of workers' compensation board of directors a report by no later than the April board meeting each year regarding sanctions rendered under this paragraph and corrective actions taken by the bureau with respect to this rule.

===================================================================



 

4123-17-62 Application for group experience rating.
(A) Sponsoring organization requirements.
(1) A sponsoring organization shall make annual application for group experience rating by submitting an employer roster for group rating plan (AC-25) for each group it sponsors. Each AC-25 shall:
(a) Be signed each year by an officer of the sponsoring organization to which the members of the group belong;
(b) Identify each individual employer to be included in the group policy year for which the group application is made; and
(c) Identify whether, in the previous policy year, each employer was:
(i) Enrolled in the same group,
(ii) Not enrolled in the same group, but enrolled in a different group sponsored by the sponsoring organization, or
(iii) Not enrolled in the same group, and not enrolled in a different group sponsored by the sponsoring organization.
(2) In the manner specified by the bureau, the sponsoring organization shall annually identify all employers that were enrolled in the group in the previous policy year but are not enrolled in the group for the policy year for which the current application is made, and specify whether the employer is enrolled in another group of the same sponsoring organization.
(3) The bureau may request from individual employers or the sponsoring organization any additional information necessary for the bureau to rule upon the application for group experience rating. Failure or refusal of the sponsoring organization to provide the requested information in the manner requested by the bureau shall be sufficient grounds for the bureau to reject the application and refuse the group's participation in group experience rating.
(4) A sponsoring organization's application for group experience rating is effective for a single policy year. Continuation of a group for subsequent years requires timely filing of an application on a yearly basis and meeting eligibility requirements set forth in rule 4123-17-61 of the Administrative Code.
(B) Employer requirements.
An employer electing to participate in group experience rating must file an application for group rating (AC-26) with the sponsoring organization of the group in which the employer seeks to participate. If the sponsoring organization elects to include the employer in its group, the sponsoring organization must file the AC-26 form electronically with the bureau by the group experience rating application deadline set forth in the appendices to rule 4123-17-74 of the Administrative Code.
(1) An employer's AC-26 shall remain in effect for all subsequent policy years when the employer remains in the same group or another group sponsored by the same sponsoring organization.
(2) The employer must file an AC-26 if the employer applies for group experience rating with a different sponsoring organization or was not group-experience rated in the previous rating year.
(3) When an employer files a new AC-26 or multiple AC-26 forms during the application period, the latest-filed AC-26 shall establish the employer's intentions for group experience rating. The employer's AC-26 shall remain effective until any of the following occurs:
(a) The employer timely files a subsequent AC-26 indicating the desire to participate in a group with a different sponsor for the upcoming policy year;
(b) The sponsoring organization for the group does not include the employer on the group roster (AC-25);
(c) The group does not reapply for group experience rating or is rejected for failure to meet group eligibility requirements; or
(d) The employer fails to meet individual eligibility requirements set forth in paragraph (B) of rule 4123-17-61 of the Administrative Code.
(C) For private employers, the sponsoring organization shall file applications on or before the date identified in appendix A to rule 4123-17-74 of the Administrative Code. For public employers, the sponsoring organization shall file applications on or before the date identified in appendix B to rule 4123-17-74 of the Administrative Code.
(1) Except as provided in rule 4123-17-69 of the Administrative Code, a sponsoring organization may not add an employer to a group after the application deadline. A sponsoring organization will be permitted to correct a clerical error that results in an employer being omitted from a group roster if:
(a) The sponsoring organization has made an error in reporting the name or risk number of the employer on the sponsoring organization's AC-25; or
(b) The sponsoring organization included the employer on the sponsoring organization's AC-25, but failed to file the employer's AC-26 with the bureau prior to the application deadline. The sponsoring organization must provide sufficient documentation, as determined by the bureau, that the employer timely filed its AC-26 with the sponsoring organization.
(2) A sponsoring organization that has applied for group experience rating may not voluntarily terminate the application during the bureau's evaluation period.
(3) Any changes to the sponsoring organization's original application must be filed in a manner prescribed by the bureau prior to the application deadline. Any rescissions made must be completed in writing, signed by an officer of the sponsoring organization to which the members of the group belong. Any changes received by the bureau after the application deadline will not be honored. The latest application form or rescission received by the bureau prior to the application deadline will be used to determine the premium obligation for the group.
(D) A sponsoring organization shall notify an employer that is participating in a group of that sponsoring organization if the employer will not be included in a group by that sponsoring organization for the next rating year.
(1) For private employer groups, the sponsoring organization shall notify the employer in writing prior to the last business day of October of the year of the group application deadline set forth in appendix A to rule 4123-17-74 of the Administrative Code.
(2) For public employer taxing district groups, the sponsoring organization shall notify the employer in writing prior to the last business day of April of the year of the group application deadline set forth in appendix B to rule 4123-17-74 of the Administrative Code.
(3) If an employer notifies the bureau that a sponsoring organization has not complied with this paragraph and the sponsoring organization fails to prove that the notice was provided in a timely manner, the bureau will, without the approval of the sponsoring organization, allow the employer to remain in the group for the rating year for which the notice was required. If that group no longer exists the bureau will, without the approval of the sponsoring organization, place the employer in a homogeneous group with the same sponsoring organization or take other appropriate action.
(E) When the bureau determines that individual employers in a proposed group do not meet the eligibility requirements set forth in rule 4123-17-61 of the Administrative Code, the bureau will notify the individual employers and the sponsoring organization of its determination. The sponsoring organization may continue in its application for group coverage without the disqualified employers, but the group must meet minimum requirements of rule 4123-17-61 of the Administrative Code.
(F) A sponsoring organization may request that an employer be removed from its group for a gross misrepresentation made on the employer's application to the group.
(1) "Gross misrepresentation" is an act by the employer that would cause financial harm to the other members of the group, and is limited to any of the following:
(a) The sponsoring organization discovers that the employer applicant for group experience rating has recently merged with one or more entities without disclosing such merger on the employer's application for membership in the group, and such merger adversely affects the experience modification (EM), as defined in rule 4123-17-03 of the Administrative Code, of the group.
(b) The sponsoring organization discovers that the employer applicant for group experience rating has failed to disclose the true nature of the employer's business pursuit on its application for membership in the group, and this failure adversely affects the EM of the group.
(2) Requests for removal of an employer pursuant to this paragraph must be submitted within thirty days of the bureau's notification to the sponsoring organization that a rate adjustment has occurred. The sponsoring organization must notify the employer of its request to remove the employer from the group for gross misrepresentation.
(3) The sponsoring organization must provide sufficient documentation, as determined by the bureau, to support its request to remove an employer from a group.
(4) The employer shall be removed from the group only with the bureau's approval.

===================================================================



 

4123-17-63 Eligibility for group experience rating-size criteria.
(A) To be eligible for group experience rating, the group taken as a whole must include at least one hundred employers, each employer being identified as a separate risk for state fund identification purposes, or the group taken as a whole must be of sufficient size that the premiums of the members, as determined by the administrator, are expected to exceed one hundred fifty thousand dollars during the coverage period, except as provided by paragraph (C) of this rule. The administrator may determine the aggregate premium of the members based upon the historical premium experience of the members, projected payroll, and anticipated premium rates. The evaluation period for determining aggregate premium shall be the rating year beginning two years prior to the coverage period.
(B) For a group of less than one hundred members, the premium requirement shall be deemed to have been satisfied if the aggregate premium to the state insurance fund for the members of the group for the rating year beginning two years prior to the coverage period exceeded one hundred fifty thousand dollars, except as provided by paragraph (C) of this rule. Failure to reach one hundred fifty thousand dollars in premium during the coverage period shall not negate the group coverage.
(C) The bureau shall calculate the premium based upon the actual experience modified premium of the member employers during the evaluation period, including any modification due to group rating. The administrator may waive the requirement that premiums exceed one hundred fifty thousand dollars during the coverage period for a continuing group of substantially similar membership if the sole reason that the premium fails to exceed one hundred and fifty thousand dollars is due to the premium modification discounts earned by the group as a direct result of safety operations of the group rating program, and not due to other factors, such as a departure of members from the group or a reduction in payroll for members of the group.

4123-17-64 Group experience rate calculations.
(A) A group meeting all the requirements for group rating shall be considered as a single employing entity for purposes of group experience rating. The eligibility of data for use in the group shall be the same as the eligibility of data for use in the individual employer's rate calculation. Credibility limits and all factors based upon credibility will apply at the group level. For catastrophe claims, the definition of a catastrophe under paragraph (A) of rule 4123-17-12 of the Administrative Code must be satisfied by an individual employer in the group to be eligible for catastrophe claim cost relief, although more than one individual employer in the group may qualify for catastrophe relief from the same catastrophe occurrence. Handicap charges to surplus shall be applied at the group level.
(B) All operations or manuals of a risk electing group rating are subject to group experience rating.
(C) Effective July 1, 2002, except with respect to mergers or transfers of the operations of a business, an employer's experience may be combined once during a policy year to create an experience modification for multiple employers grouped together for experience rating purposes.
(D) Employers participating in a group rating plan may implement the drug free workplace program.
(E) An employer that is in a cancelled coverage status for at least one full rating year as of the date that the experience modification of a group of which it had been a member is recalculated, will not be liable for any obligation nor will such employer receive the benefit of any credit associated the recalculation.

The individual employer leaving the group retains its own experience rating incurred while a member of the group for the balance of the standard experience period. The group shall not be liable for claims experience incurred by an individual employer for claims occurring after the employer has left the group.

4123-17-66 Termination and transfers for group experience rating.
This rule on termination and transfer of group experience rating shall apply at the group level after the bureau applies the applicable individual rules on transfer of experience.
(A) A group formed for the purpose of group experience rating may not retroactively include experience in a plan, exclude experience from a plan, or voluntarily terminate a plan during the policy year. A change in the name of the group will not constitute a new group. A change of the organization sponsoring a group or moving a group to a new sponsoring organization shall constitute a new group and the members of the new group must meet the homogeneity requirement of paragraph (B)(3) of rule 4123-17-61 of the Administrative Code. The amendments contained in this paragraph of this rule shall be effective for rating years beginning July 1, 2002, and thereafter. A group will be considered a continuing group if more than fifty per cent of the members of the group in the previous rating year are members of the group in the current rating year.
(B) Successor: Files petition for bankruptcy

Predecessor: Group rated with employees and reported payroll
Where one legal entity not having coverage in the most recent experience period wholly or partially succeeds another legal entity in the operation of a business, and the predecessor entity was a member of a group for experience rating, the successor shall be considered a member of the group and the successor entity's rate shall be based on the group's experience, as long as the successor employer is homogeneous to the group. For a partial transfer, the effective date of the group experience transfer shall be on the first day of the next payroll reporting period (January first or July first).
(D) Successor: Group rated
Predecessor: Experience rated (either individually or in a different group), or non-group base rated
Where a legal entity having established coverage is a member of a group for experience rating and wholly succeeds another legal entity, the successor entity shall remain a member of the group for experience rating and the experience of the predecessor shall be included with the experience of the group for the purpose of experience rating.
(E) Successor: Non-group rated
Predecessor: Group rated
Where a legal entity having established coverage is a member of a group for the purpose of experience rating and is wholly succeeded by another legal entity which is not a member of the group, the successor entity shall not become a member of the group.
(F) Successor: Group rated
Predecessor: Group rated
Where a legal entity which is a member of group for the purpose of experience rating wholly succeeds another legal entity which is also a member of the same group for the purpose of experience rating, the successor entity shall remain a member of the group for the purpose of experience rating.
(G) Successor: Group rated
Predecessor: Self-insured
When an individual employer which has returned to the state insurance fund from self-insured status and has used the self-insured experience in calculating the experience rate becomes a member of a group for the purpose of experience rating, the self-insured experience shall be included in the experience of the group for experience rating purposes. Upon returning to the state insurance fund the employer shall provide the bureau with a payroll, a list of all claims incurred while the employer was self-insured and all payments made with respect to those claims, and any additional information required by the bureau to calculate the employer's experience.
(H) Successor Group rated
Predecessor: Non-group rated
Where a legal entity succeeds in the operation of a portion of a business of another legal entity and the successor entity is a member of a group for experience rating, the successor entity shall remain a member of the group for experience rating and the experience of the predecessor shall be included with the experience of the group for the purpose of experience rating. The effective date of the group experience transfer shall be on the first day of the next payroll reporting period (January first or July first).
(I) Successor: Non-group rated
Predecessor: Group rated
Where a legal entity having established coverage succeeds in the operation of a portion of a business of another legal entity and the successor entity is not a member of a group and the predecessor is a member of a group for experience rating, the successor entity will not become a member of the group for experience rating and the predecessor will remain a member of the group.
(J) Successor: entity not having coverage
Predecessor: Group rated with no employees and no reported payroll
Where one legal entity not having coverage in the most recent experience period wholly or partially succeeds another legal entity in the operation of a business, and the predecessor entity was a member of a group for experience rating, the successor entity shall not become a member of the group unless and until the entity applies for membership in the group in the next experience period.
(K) When any combination or transfer of experience is indicated, the effective date of such combination or transfer shall be the beginning date of the next following payroll reporting period.

===================================================================



 

4123-17-68 Group experience and group retrospective safety program requirements.
(A) The purpose of this rule is to establish minimum safety requirements for group experience and group retrospective rating asprovided by section 4123.29 of the Revised Code.
(B) The bureau safety and hygiene division, upon the request of the sponsoring organization, shall provide assistance with implementing all of the provisions of this rule.
(C) The primary or affiliated sponsoring organization of a group experience or group retrospective plan shall document its program to improve accident prevention and claims handling for the members in the group with the group application, and, for an existing group reapplying for group coverage annually, shall document the effectiveness of prior programs and any proposed improvements to these programs. This analysis shall include identification of the most common injuries among group members and strategies aimed at increasing awareness and prevention of these injuries.
(1) A bureau division of safety and hygiene loss prevention representative shall review the sponsor's safety requirements annual report within sixty days of receipt. The safety and hygiene representative shall contact the primary or affiliated group sponsor or its authorized representative to assist in further developing appropriate safety strategies if there are deficiencies in the report. All primary and affiliated sponsoring organizations shall be required to sponsor a minimum of eight hours of safety training during the rating year for members of their group. Training shall be hosted by the sponsor or the sponsor's third party administrator. Training should be designed in increments of at least two hours. Training should be industry specific where possible. Webinars and online training hosted by the sponsor will qualify to fulfill this requirement. The sponsor must document the number of employers in attendance at safety training with a goal of at least fifty per cent membership attendance. If the same agenda is offered repeatedly in different regional sites, hour to hour credit will be granted. A bureau representative may attend training to ensure the requirement is being met.
(2) If an employer that participates in group rating or group retrospective rating plan sustains a claim within the "green period," the employer shall complete either of the following:
(a) The bureau's online accident analysis form and the bureau's associated online safety class, or
(b) Two hours of safety training approved by the bureau. Such training can be offered by the sponsoring organization, the sponsoring organization's third party administrator, or the bureau.
The sponsor will notify members of this requirement and maintain recordkeeping to track completion of this requirement. The sponsor will submit to the bureau a list of members completing the training required by this rule. The bureau shall reserve the right to request additional information from the sponsor to ensure compliance.
(3) The bureau safety and hygiene division shall make a recommendation to the bureau employer programs unit on whether the group's safety requirements annual report is acceptable for the following policy year. A copy of the recommendations and findings of the safety and hygiene division shall be communicated to the sponsoring organization or its authorized representative at the same time. The employer programs unit shall consider this recommendation in making its decision whether to approve the group rating application and at the time of sponsor recertification.
(4) The bureau safety and hygiene division shall evaluate the sponsor's safety requirements annual report at the sponsoring organization level and not at the individual member level. The bureau safety and hygiene safety representative may conduct member visits to confirm the sponsoring organization requirements are met.
(5) If the bureau's employer programs unit does not approve a group for group rating based upon the sponsor's safety activities, the sponsoring organization may request a hearing before the adjudicating committee pursuant to rule 4123-14-06 of the Administrative Code.
(6) Primary and affiliated sponsoring organizations shall publish in the first quarter of the rating year, for the knowledge of the members in their group, a safety accountability letter outlining the group rating safety requirements and responsibilities of all associated parties.

(A) Definitions.
As used in this rule:

The deductible selected by the employer will apply only to claims with a date of injury within the coverage period defined in the deductible agreement.

(a) "Small deductible" means a deductible less than or equal to ten thousand dollars.
(b) "Large deductible" means a deductible greater than ten thousand dollars.
(3) "Experience rated premium" means the premium obligations of an employer for the policy year excluding DWRF and administrative cost assessments. This may include any experience rated premium related to policy combinations.
(4) "Modified rate" means the rate that employers who are experience rated pay as a percentage of their payroll. This rate is calculated by taking the base rate and multiplying it by the employer's experience modification (EM) factor.
(5) "Base rate" means the rate that employers who are not experience rated pay as a percentage of their payroll.
(6) "Policy in good standing" means the employer is current on all payments due to the bureau and is in compliance with bureau laws, rules, and regulations at the time of enrollment or reenrollment.
(7) "Premium" means money paid (due) from an employer for workers' compensation insurance. It does not include money paid as fees, fines, penalties or deposits.
(8) "Qualified employer" means an employer that has a state insurance fund policy that is in good standing at the time of enrollment or reenrollment. Although the employer may be a qualified employer, the bureau may not accept the employer into the deductible program for other reasons set forth in this rule.
(B) Eligibility requirements.
(1) An employer shall be eligible to participate in the deductible program only if the employer meets all of the following requirements:
(a) As of each continuing eligibility evaluation date, the employer holds active workers' compensation coverage according to the following standards as of the original application deadline or anniversary date of participation:
(i) The employer must be current with respect to all payments due the bureau, as defined in paragraph (A)(1)(b) of rule 4123-17-14 of the Administrative Code.
(ii) The employer must be current on the payment schedule of any part-pay agreement into which it has entered for payment of premiums or assessment obligations.
(iii) If the employer selects a small deductible, the employer may not have cumulative lapses in workers' compensation coverage in excess of forty days within the preceding twelve months, except as provided in paragraphs (B)(1)(a)(iii)(a) and (B)(1)(a)(iii)(b) of this rule.
(a) For the policy year commencing July 1, 2015, private employers must not have cumulative lapses in workers' compensation coverage in excess of forty days within the preceding nine months.
(b) For policy year commencing January 1, 2016, public employer taxing districts must not have cumulative lapses in workers' compensation coverage in excess of forty days within the preceding nine months.
(iv) If the employer selects large deductible, the employer may not have cumulative lapses in workers' compensation coverage in excess of fifteen days within the preceding five years.
(v) The employer must report actual payroll for the preceding policy year and pay any premium due upon reconciliation of estimated premium and actual premium for that policy year no later than the date set forth in rule 4123-17-14 of the Administrative Code. An employer will be deemed to have met this requirement if the bureau receives the payroll report and the employer pays premium associated with such report before the expiration of any grace period established by the administrator pursuant to paragraph (B) of rule 4123-17-16 of the Administrative Code.
(b) The employer shall demonstrate the ability to make payments under the deductible program based upon a credit score established by the bureau on an annual basis which will be applicable to all applicants for the program year. The bureau shall obtain the credit reports from an established vendor of such information. An employer that is a subsidiary of another corporate entity may use the parent corporate entity's credit score in meeting this requirement if the parent corporate entity meets financial criteria for the deductible program and executes a contract of guaranty with respect to the subsidiary's participation in the program.
(c) The bureau may require an employer to adopt additional risk mitigation measures as a prerequisite for participation in the program. These measures may include, but are not limited to: adoption of an alternative payment plan, providing securitization in the form of a letter of credit or surety bond, and, for employers electing a large deductible, selection of an aggregate stop-loss limit.
(2) The following employers shall not be eligible to participate in the deductible program:
(a) State agencies.
(b) A self-insuring employer providing compensation and benefits pursuant to section 4123.35 of the Revised Code.
(C) In selecting an employer deductible program under this rule, the employer must select, on an application provided by the bureau, a per claim deductible amount, which shall be applicable for all claims with dates of injury within a one year coverage period. The employer shall choose one deductible level from the following:
(1) Five hundred dollars;
(2) One thousand dollars;
(3) Two thousand five hundred dollars;
(4) Five thousand dollars;
(5) Ten thousand dollars;
(6) Twenty-five thousand dollars;
(7) Fifty thousand dollars;
(8) One hundred thousand dollars;
(9) Two hundred thousand dollars.
(D) In choosing a small deductible, the employer may not choose a deductible amount that exceeds twenty-five per cent of their experience rated premium obligation during the most recent full policy year. For a new employer policy, the deductible amount shall not exceed twenty-five per cent of the employer's expected premium. In choosing a large deductible, the employer may not choose a deductible amount that exceeds forty per cent of their experience rated premium obligation for the most recent full policy year. For self-insured employers re-entering the state fund system, the bureau will use the paid workers' compensation benefits from the last full policy year in place of experience rated premium.
BWC may estimate a full year's premium should only a partial year be available or if no premium is available in the most recent full policy year.
(E) An employer selecting a large deductible will undergo additional credit analysis and must submit financial information to the bureau during the enrollment period preceding each policy year they elect to participate in the program.
(1) An employer choosing a deductible level of twenty-five thousand dollars or fifty thousand dollars must submit reviewed or audited financials for at least the three most recent fiscal years. The financials must be prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
(2) An employer choosing a deductible level of one hundred thousand dollars or two hundred thousand dollars must submit audited financials for at least the three most recent fiscal years. The financials must be prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
(F) An employer may request an annual aggregate stop-loss limit option in combination with large deductible levels. If the employer requests the aggregate stop-loss limit option, the bureau shall limit the employer's deductible billings for injuries which occur during the associated policy year to three times the deductible level chosen. However, the bureau may reject the employer's request to participate in the aggregate stop-loss limit option if the bureau determines that, because of the employer's premium or estimated premium size, the employer would receive a credit under this rule that would exceed the employer's maximum aggregate stop-loss liability.
(G) The employer shall file the application provided by the bureau and any other documentation required for enrollment in the deductible program by the applicable application deadline set forth in appendix A or B to rule 4123-17-74 of the Administrative Code.
The bureau shall not permit an employer to enroll in a deductible program outside of the application deadline, except that the bureau will consider an employer establishing a policy in Ohio for the first time for participation where the employer submits its deductible program application to the bureau within thirty days of obtaining coverage.
(H) Renewal in the deductible program at the same level for each subsequent year shall be automatic, subject to review by the bureau of the employer's continued eligibility under paragraph (B) of this rule, unless the employer notifies the bureau in writing that the employer does not wish to participate in the program or that the employer wants to change the deductible amount for the next coverage period. The employer shall provide such notice to the bureau within the time and in the manner provided in paragraph (G) of this rule.
(I) Except as provided in paragraph (M) of this rule, an employer shall not be permitted to withdraw from the deductible program during the policy year, and no changes shall be made with respect to any deductible amount selected by the employer within the policy year.
(J) The bureau shall pay the claims costs under a deductible program and the employer shall reimburse to the bureau the costs under the deductible program as follows:
(1) The bureau shall pay all claims costs in accordance with the laws and rules governing payment of workers' compensation benefits. For small deductible levels, the amount to be included in the employer's experience for a policy year shall be any claims costs for injuries incurred in that policy year less any deductible billed to the employer under this rule. For large deductible levels, the bureau shall include the entire claims cost for injuries incurred in a policy year in the employer's experience for that policy year.
(2) The bureau shall bill the employer on a monthly basis for any claims costs paid by the bureau for amounts subject to the deductible as elected by the employer for the policy year. In addition to amounts paid by the bureau for which the bureau is seeking reimbursement from the employer, such monthly billings shall also reflect the payments to date for any claims to which a deductible is applicable.
(3) The employer shall pay all deductible amounts billed by the bureau by the invoice due date. The employer will be subject to any interest or penalty provisions to which other monies owed the bureau are subject, including certification to the attorney general's office for collection.
(4) The employer shall continue to be liable beyond any deductible program period for billings covered under a deductible program for injuries that arose during any period for which a deductible is applicable, regardless of when payment was made by the bureau.
(K) The bureau will apply the premium reduction calculation under the deductible program directly to the base rate established for the policy year for base-rated employers, or after the modified premium rate is established for experience-rated employers, but prior to any other premium adjustments, as well as DWRF and administrative expenses. The bureau will calculate the premium reduction in accordance with the appendices of this rule, which takes into account both the deductible amount chosen by the employer and the applicable hazard group under the most current version of NCCI's hazard groupings as established by the primary manual classification of the employer as determined at the end of the enrollment period for that year.
(1) In determining the primary manual classification and appropriate hazard group, the bureau shall utilize payroll and the associated experience premium for the rating year beginning two years prior to the period in which the employer is seeking to enroll in the deductible program.
(2) For new employers, the bureau shall base the appropriate primary manual classification and hazard group upon estimated payroll.
(L) Where there is a combination or experience transfer of an employer within a deductible program policy period, following the application of any other rules applicable to a combination or experience transfer, the employer may be eligible to remain in a deductible program as follows:
(1) Successor: entity not having coverage.
Predecessor: enrolled in deductible program currently or in prior policy years.
Where there is a combination or experience transfer, where the predecessor was a participant in the deductible program and the successor is assigned a new policy with the bureau, the successor shall make application for the deductible program within thirty days of obtaining a bureau policy, as set forth in paragraph (G)(3) of this rule. Notwithstanding this election, the successor shall be responsible for any and all existing or future liabilities stemming from the predecessor's participation in the deductible program prior to the date that the bureau was notified of the transfer as provided under paragraph (C) of rule 4123-17-02 of the Administrative Code.
(2) Successor: enrolled in the deductible program.
Predecessor: not enrolled in the deductible program.
Where there is a combination or experience transfer involving two or more entities, each having Ohio coverage at the time of the combination or experience transfer, and the successor policy is enrolled in the deductible program for the program year, the successor shall automatically remain in the deductible program for the program year and is subject to renewal in accordance with paragraph (H) of this rule.
(3) Successor: not enrolled in deductible program.
Predecessor: enrolled in deductible program.
Where there is a combination or experience transfer involving two or more entities, each having Ohio coverage at the time of the combination or experience transfer, and the successor policy is not enrolled in the deductible program, the predecessor shall not be automatically entitled to continue in the deductible program. The successor may make a formal application should it desire to participate in the deductible program for the next policy year. Whether or not the successor chooses or is otherwise eligible to participate in a deductible program, under paragraph (C) of rule 4123-17-02 of the Administrative Code, the successor remains liable for any existing and future liabilities resulting from a predecessor's participation in the deductible program.
(M) The bureau may remove an employer participating in the deductible program from the program with thirty days written notice to the employer for any of the following reasons:
(1) The employer participates in any plan or program that is not compatible with the deductible program under rule 4123-17-74 of the Administrative Code.
(2) The bureau certifies a balance due from the employer to the attorney general.
(3) The employer makes direct payments to any medical provider for services rendered or supplies or to any injured worker for compensation associated with a workers' compensation claim.
(4) The employer engages in misrepresentation or fraud in conjunction with the deductible program application process.
(N) An employer removed from the deductible program for failure to comply with paragraph (B) of this rule will be required to pay:
(1) Claims costs up to the deductible selected under paragraph (C) of this rule for all injuries incurred from the beginning of policy year in which the employer participated in the deductible program through the date of removal from the program.
(2) Full experience-rated premium, without the deductible credit, from the date of removal from the deductible program through the remainder of the policy year.

===================================================================



 

4123-17-73 [Effective until 7/1/2017] Group retrospective rating program.
(A) Definitions.
As used in this rule:
(1) "Group retrospective rating" or "group retro rating" is a voluntary workers' compensation insurance program offered by the bureau of workers' compensation. Group retro rating is designed to provide financial incentive to employer groups participating in the program that, through improvements in workplace safety and injured worker outcomes, are able to keep their claim costs below a predefined level.
(2) "Basic premium factor" is a component of the retrospective rating premium formula used to account for insurance charges and costs that are distributed across all employers. The basic premium factor (BPF) is based upon charges for the cost of having retrospective premium limited by the selected maximum premium ratio and the cost of excluding surplus costs from incurred losses.
(3) "Developed losses" or "total incurred losses (developed)" are a component of the retrospective rating premium formula intended to account for the fact that total incurred losses in claims are likely to increase over time. This trend results from a number of factors, including, but not limited to, reactivation of claims, additional claim awards, and claims that may be incurred but not reported for a substantial period, and result in costs that would otherwise not be captured.
(4) "Evaluation period" means the three-year period beginning immediately after the end of the retro policy year. Annual evaluations will occur three times during the evaluation period at twelve, twenty-four, and thirty-six months after the end of the retro policy year.
(5) "Incurred losses" means compensation payments and medical payments paid to date as well as open case reserves. The total incurred losses will not include surplus costs and will be limited on a per claim basis.
(6) "Loss development factor" means actuarially determined factors that are multiplied by incurred losses of non-PTD/death retro claims to produce developed losses. Loss development factors (LDF) are unique to each retro policy year.
(7) "Maximum premium ratio" means a factor pre-selected by the retro group that is multiplied by the standard premium to determine the maximum retrospective premium for the group.
(8) "Member of a retro group" means the individual employers that participate in a group retro plan of a sponsoring organization.
(9) "Reserve" means the bureau's estimate of the future cost of a claim at a specific point in time.
(10) "Retro policy year" means the policy year in which an employer is enrolled in group retrospective rating. Claim losses which occur during this year will be tracked for all retro group members and refunds or assessments will be distributed based on those losses in the subsequent evaluation period. The retro policy year start and end date will match that of the rating policy year. For public employer taxing districts, the retro policy year shall be January first through December thirty-first of a year. For private employers, the retro policy year shall be July first through June thirtieth of the following year.
(11) "Standard premium" means the total premium paid by or on behalf of an employer for a given policy year, excluding the assessments for the disabled workers' relief fund and the administrative cost fund. In determining standard premium, total premium paid will not be reduced by any rebates or dividends issued pursuant to rule 4123-17-10 of the Administrative Code.
(12) "Application deadline" means the application deadline for group retrospective rating as set forth in appendices A and B to rule 4123-17-74 of the Administrative Code.
(B) Sponsor eligibility requirements.
Each sponsoring organization seeking to sponsor a retro group must be certified under the bureau's sponsor certification process as specified in rule 4123-17-61.1 of the Administrative Code.
(C) Retro group eligibility requirements.
Each retro group seeking to participate in the bureau group retro program shall meet the following standards:
(1) A retro group must be sponsored by a bureau certified sponsoring organization.
(2) The employers' business in the organization must be substantially similar such that the risks which are grouped are substantially homogeneous. A group shall be considered substantially homogeneous if the main operating manuals of the risks as determined by the premium obligations for the rating year beginning two years prior to the retro policy year are assigned to the same or similar industry groups. Industry groups are determined by appendix A to rule 4123-17-05 of the Administrative Code. Industry groups seven and nine as well as eight and nine are considered similar. The bureau may allow an employer to move to a more homogeneous group when, after December thirty-first for private employer groups and June thirtieth for pubic employer taxing district groups, but before the application deadline, the employer:
(a) Is an employer without a full year of recorded premium;
(b) Is reclassified as a result of an audit; or
(c) Fully or partially combines with another employer.
(3) A retro group of employers must have aggregate standard premium in excess of one million dollars, as determined by the administrator based upon the last full policy year for which premium information is available.
(a) For employers without a full year of recorded premium, the bureau may use the employer's expected premium.
(b) The bureau shall calculate the premium based upon the experience modified premium of the individual employers excluding group rating discounts.
(4) The retro group must include at least two employers.
(5) The formation and operation of the retro group program by the organization must substantially improve accident prevention and claims handling for the employers in the retro group. The bureau shall require the retro group to document its safety plan or program for these purposes, and, for retro groups reapplying annually for group retro coverage, the results of prior programs. The safety plan must follow the guidelines and criteria set forth under rule 4123-17-68 of the Administrative Code.
(D) Employer eligibility requirements.
Each employer seeking to participate in the bureau group retrospective program must meet the following standards:
(1) The employer must be a private state funded employer or public employer taxing district. A self-insuring employer or a state agency public employer shall not be eligible for participation in the group retro program.
(2) Each employer seeking to enroll in a retro group for workers' compensation coverage must have active workers' compensation coverage according to the following standards:
(a) As of the application deadline, the employer must be current with respect to all payments due the bureau, as defined in paragraph (A)(1)(b) of rule 4123-17-14 of the Administrative Code.
(b) As of the application deadline for group retrospective rating, the employer must be current on the payment schedule of any part-pay agreement into which it has entered for payment of premiums or assessment obligations.
(c) Except as provided for in paragraphs (D)(2)(c)(i) and (D)(2)(c)(ii) of this rule, the employer cannot have cumulative lapses in workers' compensation coverage in excess of forty days within the twelve months preceding the application deadline date for group retro rating.
(i) For the policy year commencing July 1, 2015, private employers must not have cumulative lapses in workers' compensation coverage in excess of forty days within the preceding nine months.
(ii) For policy year commencing January 1, 2016, public employer taxing districts must not have cumulative lapses in workers' compensation coverage in excess of forty days within the preceding nine months.
(d) The employer must report actual payroll for the preceding policy year and pay any premium due upon reconciliation of estimated premium and actual premium for that policy year no later than the date set forth in rule 4123-17-14 of the Administrative Code. An employer will be deemed to have met this requirement if the bureau receives the payroll report and the employer pays premium associated with such report before the expiration of any grace period established by the administrator pursuant to paragraph (B) of rule 4123-17-16 of the Administrative Code.
(3) No employer may be a member of more than one retro group or a retro and non-retro group for the purpose of obtaining workers' compensation coverage. An employer who has been included on a group experience rating roster for the upcoming policy year may not elect to participate in group retrospective rating after the deadline for group experience rating set forth in rule 4123-17-74 of the Administrative Code.
(4) An employer must be homogeneous with the industry group of the retro group as defined in paragraph (C)(2) of this rule.
An individual employer member of a continuing retro group who initially satisfied the homogeneous requirement shall not be disqualified from participation in the continuing retro group for failure to continue to satisfy such requirement.
(E) A sponsoring organization shall make application for group retro on a form provided by the bureau and shall complete the application in its entirety with all documentation attached as required by the bureau. If the sponsoring organization fails to include all pertinent information, the bureau will reject the application.
(1) The group retro application (U-151) shall be signed each year by an officer of the sponsoring organization.
(2) The sponsoring organization shall identify each individual employer in the retro group on an employer roster for group retro plan (U-152).
(F) A retro group's application for group retrospective rating is applicable to only one policy year. The retro group must reapply each year for group retro coverage. Continuation of a plan for subsequent years is subject to timely filing of an application on a yearly basis and the meeting of eligibility requirements each year.
(G) Upon receipt of an application for retro group, the bureau shall do the following:
(1) Determine the industry classification of the retro group based upon the makeup of retro group employers submitted.
(2) Screen prospective retro group members to ensure that their business operations fit appropriately in the retro group's industry classification.
(3) In reviewing the retro group's application, if the bureau determines that individual employers in the retro group do not meet the eligibility requirements for group retrospective rating, the bureau will notify the individual employers and the retro group of this fact, and the retro group may continue in its application for group retro coverage without the disqualified employers.
(H) The group retro sponsor shall submit to the bureau an employer statement (U-153) each year for each employer that wishes to participate in group retrospective rating with the sponsor. Where an employer files a new employer statement form in the sixty days prior to the application deadline, it shall be presumed that the latest filed employer statement form of the employer indicates the employer's intentions for group retro. An employer statement form shall remain effective until the end of the policy year as defined on the employer statement form.
(I) The bureau may request of individual employers or the retro group sponsor, additional information necessary for the bureau to rule upon the application for group retro participation. Failure or refusal of the retro group sponsor to provide the requested information on the forms or computer formats provided by the bureau shall be sufficient grounds for the bureau to reject the application and refuse the retro group's participation in group retrospective rating program.
(J) Individual employers who are not included on the final retro group roster or do not have an individual employer application (U-153) for the same retro group or another retro group sponsored by the same sponsoring organization on file by the application deadline, will not be considered for the group retro plan for that policy year; however, the bureau may waive this requirement for good cause shown due to clerical or administrative error, so long as no employer is added to a retro group after the application deadline. The group retro sponsor shall submit all information to the bureau by the application deadline.
(K) Once a retro group has applied for group retrospective rating, the organization may not voluntarily terminate the application. All changes to the original application must be filed on a bureau form provided for the application for the group retrospective rating plan and must be filed prior to the filing deadline. Any rescissions made must be completed in writing, signed by an officer of the sponsoring organization and filed prior to the filing deadline. The retro group may make no changes to the application after the last day for filing the application. Any changes received by the bureau after the filing deadline will not be honored. The latest application form or rescission received by the bureau prior to the filing deadline will be used in determining the premium obligation.
(L) After the group retro application deadline but before the end of the policy year for the retro group, the sponsoring organization may notify the bureau that it wishes to remove an employer from participation in the retro group. The sponsoring organization may request that the employer be removed from the retro group after the application deadline only for the employer's gross misrepresentation on its application to the retro group.
(1) "Gross misrepresentation" is an act by the employer that would cause financial harm to the other members of the retro group and is limited to any of the following:
(a) The sponsoring organization discovers that the employer applicant for group retro rating has recently merged with one or more entities without disclosing such merger on the employer's application for membership in the retro group, and such merger adversely affects the employer's risk of future losses.
(b) The sponsoring organization discovers that the employer applicant for group retrospective rating has failed to disclose the true nature of the employer's business pursuit on its application for membership in the retro group, and this failure adversely affects the loss potential of the retro group.
(2) The sponsoring organization must provide sufficient documentation, as determined by the bureau, to support its request to remove an employer from a retro group.
(3) The employer shall be removed from the group only with the bureau's approval.
(M) An employer will be removed from the group retrospective rating program for the current policy year for failure to comply with paragraph (D)(2)(d) of this rule and the following will apply:
(1) Claims costs according to this rule for all injuries incurred from the beginning of the policy year in which the employer participated in group retrospective rating through the date of removal from the program shall be included in the group retrospective calculation; and
(2) Only premium from the beginning of the policy year through the date of removal will be included in the group retrospective calculation for the participation policy year.
(N) A retro group formed for the purpose of group retrospective rating may not voluntarily terminate a plan during the policy year. A change in the name of the retro group will not constitute a new retro group. A change of the organization sponsoring a retro group or moving a retro group to a new sponsoring organization shall constitute a new retro group and the members of the new retro group must meet the homogeneity requirement of paragraph (C)(2) of this rule. A retro group shall be considered a continuing retro group if more than fifty per cent of the members of the retro group in the previous rating year are members of the retro group in the current rating year.
(O) Selection of an authorized representative for the retro group shall meet the following requirements:
(1) A retro group that has been established and has been accepted by the bureau of workers' compensation for the purpose of group retrospective rating shall have no more than one permanent authorized representative for representation of the retro group and the individual employers of the retro group before the bureau and the industrial commission in any and all risk-related matters pertaining to participation in the workers' compensation fund.
(2) The selection of an authorized representative must be made by submission of a completed form U-151, and any change or termination of the authorized representative can be made only by a subsequent submission of form U-151. Only an officer of the sponsoring organization may sign a U-151.
(P) The bureau shall consider an employer individually when assessing the premium payments for the retro policy year. The retro group will be considered a single entity for purposes of calculating group retrospective premium adjustments.
(Q) The group retrospective premium calculation will occur at twelve, twenty-four, and thirty-six months following the end of the group retro policy year.
(1) On the evaluation date, the bureau will evaluate all claims with injury dates that fall within the retro policy year. The incurred losses and reserves that have been established for these claims are "captured" or "frozen." The group's retrospective premium will be calculated based on the developed incurred losses of the group. The group retrospective premium will be compared to the group standard premium (the combined standard premiums of retro group members for the retro policy year) and all subsequent group retro refunds/assessments. The difference will be distributed or billed to employers as a refund or assessment.
(a) These assessments will be limited per a maximum premium ratio selected during the group retro application process.
(b) Any reserving method that suppresses some portion of an employer's costs for the purpose of calculating an experience modification will not apply in the calculation of incurred losses for group retrospective rating.
(c) The bureau may hold a portion of refunds or defer assessments owed in the first and second evaluation periods to minimize the volatility of refunds and assessments. Any net refund or assessment will be fully distributed or billed by the bureau in the third evaluation period.
(2) Incurred losses used in the retrospective premium will be limited to five hundred thousand dollars per claim.
(3) Incurred losses will not include surplus or VSSR costs.
(R) The retrospective premium calculation that will occur at various evaluation points after the retro policy year end will be as follows (please note that standard premium and developed incurred losses are for the total of the entire retro group):
Group retrospective premium =
(Basic premium factor x standard premium)
+
developed incurred losses
(1) A group will elect a maximum premium ratio for the group each year as part of the group retro application process. This ratio will determine the maximum amount of total premium a retro group may pay after refunds and assessments.
(2) Options for the maximum premium ratio will be as set forth in appendix A to this rule.
(3) A basic premium factor is applied in the retro premium calculation to account for insurance costs, surplus costs, and a per claim cap. The basic premium factor is determined using the following factors: group size by standard premium and maximum premium ratio.
(4) Developed incurred losses are created by totaling incurred losses and reserves for the entire retro group and applying an actuarially determined loss development factor as defined in appendix C to this rule.
(5) Refunds and assessments will be distributed directly to group retro employers.
The amount refunded or assessed to an individual employer will be based upon the percentage of the total group standard premium paid by the employer at the time of evaluation. The refund or assessment will be multiplied by this percentage and the resulting amount will be distributed or billed to the employer.
(6) Within four months of the evaluation date, if entitled, the bureau will send premium refunds.
(7) If additional premium is owed, it will be included in the employer's next invoice and must be paid by the due date stated on the invoice. The bureau will charge penalties on any additional premium not paid when it is due. If the group retro member is entitled to a refund for one retro policy year and owes any additional monies to the bureau, the bureau will deduct the monies due the bureau from the refund. The bureau will refund the difference to the group retro member. In the event that this adjustment still leaves a premium balance due, the bureau will send a bill for the balance.
(S) Terminations, transfers, and change of ownership will be handled in regards to group retrospective as follows:
(1) Predecessor: enrolled in group retro program.
Successor: new entity.
Where there is a combination or experience transfer during the current policy year or the sixty days preceding the application deadline for the upcoming policy year, wherein the predecessor was a participant in or applicant for the group retro program, and the successor is assigned a new policy with the bureau, the successor may be considered a member of the group retro program if agreed to by both the succeeding employer and the group retro sponsor. Written agreement signed by both the succeeding employer and the group retro sponsor must be received by the bureau within thirty days of the date of succession. If the succeeding employer and the group sponsor agree to successor joining the retro group, the successor's group retro evaluation shall be based on the group's reported payroll and claims incurred. Notwithstanding this election, the successor shall be responsible for any and all existing or future rights and obligations stemming from the predecessor's participation in the group retro program prior to the date that the bureau was notified of the transfer as prescribed under paragraph (C) of rule 4123-17-02 of the Administrative Code.
(2) Predecessor: not enrolled in group retro program.
Successor: enrolled in group retro program.
Where one legal entity that has established coverage and is enrolled in the group retro program, wholly succeeds one or more legal entities having established coverage and the predecessor entities are not enrolled in the group retro program at the date of succession, the payroll reported and claims incurred by the predecessor from the date of succession to the end of the policy year, shall be included in successor's retrospective rating plan. If the predecessor had at any time participated in a group retro program, the successor shall be responsible for any and all existing or future rights and obligations stemming from the predecessor's participation in the group retro program prior to the date that the bureau was notified of the transfer as prescribed under paragraph (C) of rule 4123-17-02 of the Administrative Code.
(3) Predecessor: enrolled in group retro program.
Successor: not enrolled in group retro program.
Where one legal entity that has established coverage and is not currently enrolled in a group retro plan wholly succeeds one or more entities that are enrolled in a group retro plan, predecessor's plan(s) shall terminate as of the ending date of the evaluation period. Payroll reported and claims incurred on or after the date of succession will be the responsibility of the successor under its current rating plan. The successor shall be responsible for any and all existing or future rights and obligations stemming from the predecessor's participation in the group retro program prior to the date that the bureau was notified of the transfer as prescribed under paragraph (C) of rule 4123-17-02 of the Administrative Code.
(4) Predecessor: enrolled in group retro program.
Successor: enrolled in different group retro program.
Where one legal entity that has established coverage and is enrolled in a group retro plan wholly succeeds one or more entities that are enrolled in a group retro plan, predecessor's plan(s) shall terminate as of the ending date of the evaluation period. Payroll reported and claims incurred on or after the date of succession will be the responsibility of the successor under its group retro plan. The successor shall be responsible for any and all existing or future rights and obligations stemming from the predecessor's participation in the group retro program prior to the date that the bureau was notified of the transfer as prescribed under paragraph (C) of rule 4123-17-02 of the Administrative Code.
(5) Predecessor: enrolled in group retro program.
Successor: enrolled in same group retro program.
Where one legal entity that has established coverage and is enrolled in a group retro plan wholly succeeds one or more entities that are enrolled in the same group retro plan, the successor shall be responsible for any and all existing or future liabilities stemming from the predecessor's participation in the group retro program prior to the date that the bureau was notified of the transfer as prescribed under paragraph (C) of rule 4123-17-02 of the Administrative Code. If the predecessor had at any time participated in a different group retro program, the successor shall be responsible for any and all existing or future rights and obligations stemming from the predecessor's participation in the group retro program prior to the date that the bureau was notified of the transfer as prescribed under paragraph (C) of rule 4123-17-02 of the Administrative Code.
(6) Successor: cancels coverage and was enrolled in group retro program.
Predecessor: no predecessor.
If the successor cancels coverage and there is no predecessor, the premium and losses of the canceling employer will remain with the retro group for future retrospective premium calculations. The resulting refund or assessment will be collected from the remaining members of the retro group.
Group retro sponsors and authorized representatives have the right to represent the interest of the canceled employer on behalf of the group with regard to claims which occurred during the year or years the employer was active in a retro group sponsored by the organization.
(7) Successor and/or predecessor: open group retro policy years in the evaluation period.
If the successor and predecessor are not currently enrolled in the group retro program, but either or both have open group retro policy years in the evaluation period, the successor shall be responsible for any and all existing or future rights and obligations stemming from the predecessor's participation in the group retro program prior to the date that the bureau was notified of the transfer as prescribed under paragraph (C) of rule 4123-17-02 of the Administrative Code.
(8) Partial transfer.
If an entity partially succeeds another entity and the predecessor entity has any group retro policy years in the evaluation period, the predecessor entity will retain any rights to assessments or refunds. If the successor is enrolled in the group retro program, payroll reported and claims incurred on or after the date of the partial transfer will be the responsibility of the successor under its group retro plan.
(9) Successor: files a petition for bankruptcy.
Predecessor: no predecessor.
If a current or previously group retro program employer with open retro policy years files a petition for bankruptcy under chapter seven or chapter eleven of the federal bankruptcy law, that employer shall notify the bureau legal division by certified mail within five working days from the date of the bankruptcy filing. The bureau will petition the bankruptcy court to take appropriate action to protect the state insurance fund and other related funds.

(b) As of the application deadline for group retrospective rating, the employer must be current on the payment schedule of any part-pay agreement into which it has entered for payment of premiums or assessment obligations.
(c) Except as provided for in paragraphs (D)(2)(c)(i) and (D)(2)(c)(ii) of this rule, the employer cannot have cumulative lapses in workers' compensation coverage in excess of forty days within the twelve months preceding the application deadline date for group retro rating.
(i) For the policy year commencing July 1, 2015, private employers must not have cumulative lapses in workers' compensation coverage in excess of forty days within the preceding nine months.
(ii) For policy year commencing January 1, 2016, public employer taxing districts must not have cumulative lapses in workers' compensation coverage in excess of forty days within the preceding nine months.
(d) The employer must report actual payroll for the preceding policy year and pay any premium due upon reconciliation of estimated premium and actual premium for that policy year no later than the date set forth in rule 4123-17-14 of the Administrative Code. An employer will be deemed to have met this requirement if the bureau receives the payroll report and the employer pays premium associated with such report before the expiration of any grace period established by the administrator pursuant to paragraph (B) of rule 4123-17-16 of the Administrative Code.
(3) No employer may be a member of more than one retro group or a retro and non-retro group for the purpose of obtaining workers' compensation coverage. An employer who has been included on a group experience rating roster for the upcoming policy year may not elect to participate in group retrospective rating after the deadline for group experience rating set forth in rule 4123-17-74 of the Administrative Code.
(4) An employer must be homogeneous with the industry group of the retro group as defined in paragraph (C)(2) of this rule.
An individual employer member of a continuing retro group who initially satisfied the homogeneous requirement shall not be disqualified from participation in the continuing retro group for failure to continue to satisfy such requirement.
(E) A sponsoring organization shall make application for group retro on a form provided by the bureau and shall complete the application in its entirety with all documentation attached as required by the bureau. If the sponsoring organization fails to include all pertinent information, the bureau will reject the application.
(1) The group retro application (U-151) shall be signed each year by an officer of the sponsoring organization.
(2) The sponsoring organization shall identify each individual employer in the retro group on an employer roster for group retro plan (U-152).
(F) A retro group's application for group retrospective rating is applicable to only one policy year. The retro group must reapply each year for group retro coverage. Continuation of a plan for subsequent years is subject to timely filing of an application on a yearly basis and the meeting of eligibility requirements each year.
(G) Upon receipt of an application for retro group, the bureau shall do the following:
(1) Determine the industry classification of the retro group based upon the makeup of retro group employers submitted.
(2) Screen prospective retro group members to ensure that their business operations fit appropriately in the retro group's industry classification.
(3) In reviewing the retro group's application, if the bureau determines that individual employers in the retro group do not meet the eligibility requirements for group retrospective rating, the bureau will notify the individual employers and the retro group of this fact, and the retro group may continue in its application for group retro coverage without the disqualified employers.
(H) The group retro sponsor shall submit to the bureau an employer statement (U-153) each year for each employer that wishes to participate in group retrospective rating with the sponsor. Where an employer files a new employer statement form in the sixty days prior to the application deadline, it shall be presumed that the latest filed employer statement form of the employer indicates the employer's intentions for group retro. An employer statement form shall remain effective until the end of the policy year as defined on the employer statement form.
(I) The bureau may request of individual employers or the retro group sponsor, additional information necessary for the bureau to rule upon the application for group retro participation. Failure or refusal of the retro group sponsor to provide the requested information on the forms or computer formats provided by the bureau shall be sufficient grounds for the bureau to reject the application and refuse the retro group's participation in group retrospective rating program.
(J) Individual employers who are not included on the final retro group roster or do not have an individual employer application (U-153) for the same retro group or another retro group sponsored by the same sponsoring organization on file by the application deadline, will not be considered for the group retro plan for that policy year; however, the bureau may waive this requirement for good cause shown due to clerical or administrative error, so long as no employer is added to a retro group after the application deadline. The group retro sponsor shall submit all information to the bureau by the application deadline.
(K) Once a retro group has applied for group retrospective rating, the organization may not voluntarily terminate the application. All changes to the original application must be filed on a bureau form provided for the application for the group retrospective rating plan and must be filed prior to the filing deadline. Any rescissions made must be completed in writing, signed by an officer of the sponsoring organization and filed prior to the filing deadline. The retro group may make no changes to the application after the last day for filing the application. Any changes received by the bureau after the filing deadline will not be honored. The latest application form or rescission received by the bureau prior to the filing deadline will be used in determining the premium obligation.
(L) After the group retro application deadline but before the end of the policy year for the retro group, the sponsoring organization may notify the bureau that it wishes to remove an employer from participation in the retro group. The sponsoring organization may request that the employer be removed from the retro group after the application deadline only for the employer's gross misrepresentation on its application to the retro group.
(1) "Gross misrepresentation" is an act by the employer that would cause financial harm to the other members of the retro group and is limited to any of the following:
(a) The sponsoring organization discovers that the employer applicant for group retro rating has recently merged with one or more entities without disclosing such merger on the employer's application for membership in the retro group, and such merger adversely affects the employer's risk of future losses.
(b) The sponsoring organization discovers that the employer applicant for group retrospective rating has failed to disclose the true nature of the employer's business pursuit on its application for membership in the retro group, and this failure adversely affects the loss potential of the retro group.
(2) The sponsoring organization must provide sufficient documentation, as determined by the bureau, to support its request to remove an employer from a retro group.
(3) The employer shall be removed from the group only with the bureau's approval.
(M) An employer will be removed from the group retrospective rating program for the current policy year for failure to comply with paragraph (D)(2)(d) of this rule and the following will apply:
(1) Claims costs according to this rule for all injuries incurred from the beginning of the policy year in which the employer participated in group retrospective rating through the date of removal from the program shall be included in the group retrospective calculation; and
(2) Only premium from the beginning of the policy year through the date of removal will be included in the group retrospective calculation for the participation policy year.
(N) A retro group formed for the purpose of group retrospective rating may not voluntarily terminate a plan during the policy year. A change in the name of the retro group will not constitute a new retro group. A change of the organization sponsoring a retro group or moving a retro group to a new sponsoring organization shall constitute a new retro group and the members of the new retro group must meet the homogeneity requirement of paragraph (C)(2) of this rule. A retro group shall be considered a continuing retro group if more than fifty per cent of the members of the retro group in the previous rating year are members of the retro group in the current rating year.
(O) Selection of an authorized representative for the retro group shall meet the following requirements:
(1) A retro group that has been established and has been accepted by the bureau of workers' compensation for the purpose of group retrospective rating shall have no more than one permanent authorized representative for representation of the retro group and the individual employers of the retro group before the bureau and the industrial commission in any and all risk-related matters pertaining to participation in the workers' compensation fund.
(2) The selection of an authorized representative must be made by submission of a completed form U-151, and any change or termination of the authorized representative can be made only by a subsequent submission of form U-151. Only an officer of the sponsoring organization may sign a U-151.
(P) The bureau shall consider an employer individually when assessing the premium payments for the retro policy year. The retro group will be considered a single entity for purposes of calculating group retrospective premium adjustments.
(Q) The group retrospective premium calculation will occur at twelve, twenty-four, and thirty-six months following the end of the group retro policy year.
(1) On the evaluation date, the bureau will evaluate all claims with injury dates that fall within the retro policy year. The incurred losses and reserves that have been established for these claims are "captured" or "frozen." The group's retrospective premium will be calculated based on the developed incurred losses of the group. The group retrospective premium will be compared to the group standard premium (the combined standard premiums of retro group members for the retro policy year) and all subsequent group retro refunds/assessments. The difference will be distributed or billed to employers as a refund or assessment.
(a) These assessments will be limited per a maximum premium ratio selected during the group retro application process.
(b) Any reserving method that suppresses some portion of an employer's costs for the purpose of calculating an experience modification will not apply in the calculation of incurred losses for group retrospective rating.
(c) The bureau may hold a portion of refunds or defer assessments owed in the first and second evaluation periods to minimize the volatility of refunds and assessments. Any net refund or assessment will be fully distributed or billed by the bureau in the third evaluation period.
(2) Incurred losses used in the retrospective premium will be limited to five hundred thousand dollars per claim.
(3) Incurred losses will not include surplus or VSSR costs.
(R) The retrospective premium calculation that will occur at various evaluation points after the retro policy year end will be as follows (please note that standard premium and developed incurred losses are for the total of the entire retro group):
Group retrospective premium =
(Basic premium factor x standard premium)
+
developed incurred losses
(1) A group will elect a maximum premium ratio for the group each year as part of the group retro application process. This ratio will determine the maximum amount of total premium a retro group may pay after refunds and assessments.
(2) Options for the maximum premium ratio will be as set forth in appendix A to this rule.
(3) A basic premium factor is applied in the retro premium calculation to account for insurance costs, surplus costs, and a per claim cap. The basic premium factor is determined using the following factors: group size by standard premium and maximum premium ratio.
(4) Developed incurred losses are created by totaling incurred losses and reserves for the entire retro group and applying an actuarially determined loss development factor as defined in appendix C to this rule.
(5) Refunds and assessments will be distributed directly to group retro employers.
The amount refunded or assessed to an individual employer will be based upon the percentage of the total group standard premium paid by the employer at the time of evaluation. The refund or assessment will be multiplied by this percentage and the resulting amount will be distributed or billed to the employer.
(6) Within four months of the evaluation date, if entitled, the bureau will send premium refunds.
(7) If additional premium is owed, it will be included in the employer's next invoice and must be paid by the due date stated on the invoice. The bureau will charge penalties on any additional premium not paid when it is due. If the group retro member is entitled to a refund for one retro policy year and owes any additional monies to the bureau, the bureau will deduct the monies due the bureau from the refund. The bureau will refund the difference to the group retro member. In the event that this adjustment still leaves a premium balance due, the bureau will send a bill for the balance.
(S) Terminations, transfers, and change of ownership will be handled in regards to group retrospective as follows:
(1) Predecessor: enrolled in group retro program.
Successor: new entity.
Where there is a combination or experience transfer during the current policy year or the sixty days preceding the application deadline for the upcoming policy year, wherein the predecessor was a participant in or applicant for the group retro program, and the successor is assigned a new policy with the bureau, the successor may be considered a member of the group retro program if agreed to by both the succeeding employer and the group retro sponsor. Written agreement signed by both the succeeding employer and the group retro sponsor must be received by the bureau within thirty days of the date of succession. If the succeeding employer and the group sponsor agree to successor joining the retro group, the successor's group retro evaluation shall be based on the group's reported payroll and claims incurred. Notwithstanding this election, the successor shall be responsible for any and all existing or future rights and obligations stemming from the predecessor's participation in the group retro program prior to the date that the bureau was notified of the transfer as prescribed under paragraph (C) of rule 4123-17-02 of the Administrative Code.
(2) Predecessor: not enrolled in group retro program.
Successor: enrolled in group retro program.
Where one legal entity that has established coverage and is enrolled in the group retro program, wholly succeeds one or more legal entities having established coverage and the predecessor entities are not enrolled in the group retro program at the date of succession, the payroll reported and claims incurred by the predecessor from the date of succession to the end of the policy year, shall be included in successor's retrospective rating plan. If the predecessor had at any time participated in a group retro program, the successor shall be responsible for any and all existing or future rights and obligations stemming from the predecessor's participation in the group retro program prior to the date that the bureau was notified of the transfer as prescribed under paragraph (C) of rule 4123-17-02 of the Administrative Code.
(3) Predecessor: enrolled in group retro program.
Successor: not enrolled in group retro program.
Where one legal entity that has established coverage and is not currently enrolled in a group retro plan wholly succeeds one or more entities that are enrolled in a group retro plan, predecessor's plan(s) shall terminate as of the ending date of the evaluation period. Payroll reported and claims incurred on or after the date of succession will be the responsibility of the successor under its current rating plan. The successor shall be responsible for any and all existing or future rights and obligations stemming from the predecessor's participation in the group retro program prior to the date that the bureau was notified of the transfer as prescribed under paragraph (C) of rule 4123-17-02 of the Administrative Code.
(4) Predecessor: enrolled in group retro program.
Successor: enrolled in different group retro program.
Where one legal entity that has established coverage and is enrolled in a group retro plan wholly succeeds one or more entities that are enrolled in a group retro plan, predecessor's plan(s) shall terminate as of the ending date of the evaluation period. Payroll reported and claims incurred on or after the date of succession will be the responsibility of the successor under its group retro plan. The successor shall be responsible for any and all existing or future rights and obligations stemming from the predecessor's participation in the group retro program prior to the date that the bureau was notified of the transfer as prescribed under paragraph (C) of rule 4123-17-02 of the Administrative Code.
(5) Predecessor: enrolled in group retro program.
Successor: enrolled in same group retro program.
Where one legal entity that has established coverage and is enrolled in a group retro plan wholly succeeds one or more entities that are enrolled in the same group retro plan, the successor shall be responsible for any and all existing or future liabilities stemming from the predecessor's participation in the group retro program prior to the date that the bureau was notified of the transfer as prescribed under paragraph (C) of rule 4123-17-02 of the Administrative Code. If the predecessor had at any time participated in a different group retro program, the successor shall be responsible for any and all existing or future rights and obligations stemming from the predecessor's participation in the group retro program prior to the date that the bureau was notified of the transfer as prescribed under paragraph (C) of rule 4123-17-02 of the Administrative Code.
(6) Successor: cancels coverage and was enrolled in group retro program.
Predecessor: no predecessor.
If the successor cancels coverage and there is no predecessor, the premium and losses of the canceling employer will remain with the retro group for future retrospective premium calculations. The resulting refund or assessment will be collected from the remaining members of the retro group.
Group retro sponsors and authorized representatives have the right to represent the interest of the canceled employer on behalf of the group with regard to claims which occurred during the year or years the employer was active in a retro group sponsored by the organization.
(7) Successor and/or predecessor: open group retro policy years in the evaluation period.
If the successor and predecessor are not currently enrolled in the group retro program, but either or both have open group retro policy years in the evaluation period, the successor shall be responsible for any and all existing or future rights and obligations stemming from the predecessor's participation in the group retro program prior to the date that the bureau was notified of the transfer as prescribed under paragraph (C) of rule 4123-17-02 of the Administrative Code.
(8) Partial transfer.
If an entity partially succeeds another entity and the predecessor entity has any group retro policy years in the evaluation period, the predecessor entity will retain any rights to assessments or refunds. If the successor is enrolled in the group retro program, payroll reported and claims incurred on or after the date of the partial transfer will be the responsibility of the successor under its group retro plan.
(9) Successor: files a petition for bankruptcy.
Predecessor: no predecessor.
If a current or previously group retro program employer with open retro policy years files a petition for bankruptcy under chapter seven or chapter eleven of the federal bankruptcy law, that employer shall notify the bureau legal division by certified mail within five working days from the date of the bankruptcy filing. The bureau will petition the bankruptcy court to take appropriate action to protect the state insurance fund and other related funds.

--->ohio--->Ohio Rules--->Chapter 4123: Bureau of Workers' Compensation--->Chapter 4123-18 Rehabilitation of Injured and Disabled Workers--->4123-18-03 Guidelines for referral to and acceptance into vocational rehabilitation.
===================================================================



 

4123-18-03 Guidelines for referral to and acceptance into vocational rehabilitation.
(A) Scope of vocational rehabilitation.
(1) Vocational rehabilitation is the process of restoring the vocational functioning of a worker who experiences an industrial injury or occupational disease and who voluntarily agrees to participate in vocational rehabilitation. Vocational rehabilitation services are focused on return to work and are not reimbursable from the surplus fund if solely directed toward the medical management of a claim.
(2) The vocational rehabilitation rules of Chapter 4123-18 of the Administrative Code shall aid in the development of procedures for providing reimbursable vocational rehabilitation services.
(B) Referrals for vocational rehabilitation services.
(1) Anyone can refer an injured worker for vocational rehabilitation services.
(2) The bureau shall determine the eligibility of an injured worker referred for vocational rehabilitation services.
(3) Once eligibility has been determined, the MCO shall contact the injured worker referred for vocational rehabilitation services within three working days.
(4) After the MCO contacts the injured worker, the MCO, with bureau oversight, shall determine the feasibility of the injured worker referred for vocational rehabilitation services.
(5) An injured worker shall not be able to participate in a vocational rehabilitation plan or receive vocational rehabilitation services until the injured worker has been determined to be both eligible and feasible for vocational rehabilitation services.
(6) Referrals for vocational rehabilitation in inactive claims shall be processed in accordance with rule 4123-3-15 of the Administrative Code.
(C) Eligibility for vocational rehabilitation services.

--->ohio--->Ohio Rules--->Chapter 4123: Bureau of Workers' Compensation--->Chapter 4123-18 Rehabilitation of Injured and Disabled Workers--->4123-18-04 Living maintenance allowance.
===================================================================



 

4123-18-04 Living maintenance allowance.
The bureau shall order living maintenance to be paid from the surplus fund, established by section 4123.34 of the Revised Code, to each injured worker in accordance with the guidelines listed below. Living maintenance payments are compensation under Chapters 4121. and 4123. of the Revised Code.
An injured worker is eligible for living maintenance payments in accordance with the guidelines of this rule.
(A) Living maintenance payments shall begin on the date that the injured worker actually begins to participate in an approved vocational rehabilitation assessment plan or comprehensive vocational rehabilitation plan as defined in rule 4123-18-05 of the Administrative Code . Living maintenance is not payable on the date of referral for vocational rehabilitation services, nor the date the injured worker signed the rehabilitation agreement. Activities performed prior to the injured worker's active participation in the approved vocational rehabilitation assessment plan and/or comprehensive vocational rehabilitation plan are considered pre-plan activities for which living maintenance is not paid.
If salary continuation is offered by the employer of record, an injured worker maintains the right to choose to receive either salary continuation or living maintenance during vocational rehabilitation. However, if temporary total or living maintenance has been paid in the claim, the injured worker shall be paid living maintenance when participating in an approved vocational rehabilitation assessment plan or comprehensive vocational rehabilitation plan. Whenever salary continuation is paid by the employer, it must be paid at the injured worker's regular (full) salary level.
(B) The bureau shall order suspension of living maintenance payments at such time as it becomes evident that the injured worker will not be able to participate actively in their vocational rehabilitation assessment plan or comprehensive vocational rehabilitation plan for a period of thirty days or more due to the medical instability of the injured worker. The suspension of living maintenance shall not affect an injured worker's right to compensation or benefits under the Revised Code for which the injured worker otherwise qualifies.
(1) The bureau shall assist the injured worker in obtaining the payment of other workers' compensation benefits to which the injured worker would normally be entitled absent involvement in a vocational rehabilitation assessment plan or comprehensive vocational rehabilitation plan upon the cessation of living maintenance payments.
(2) Medical hold and eligibility.
Upon request from the MCO, the bureau shall determine whether, based on adequate medical documentation, the injured worker's vocational rehabilitation plan should be closed with a medical hold.
(a) A medical hold will retain the injured worker's eligibility for vocational rehabilitation services for up to a maximum of two years from the date of vocational rehabilitation assessment plan or comprehensive vocational rehabilitation plan file closure. The bureau and the MCO shall thereafter monitor the injured worker's medical status with the attending physician.
(b) When the bureau becomes aware of the re-stabilization of the injured worker's medical condition, the injured worker's vocational rehabilitation assessment plan or comprehensive vocational rehabilitation plan shall be reactivated and, absent any extenuating circumstances, appropriate rehabilitation services shall begin as soon as possible.
(C) The bureau shall order termination of living maintenance payments upon the earlier of:
(1) The injured worker's return to work other than as part of a gradual return to work plan; or
(2) Closure of the injured worker's vocational rehabilitation assessment plan or comprehensive vocational rehabilitation plan pursuant to paragraph (E) of rule 4123-18-05 of the Administrative Code.
The termination of living maintenance shall not affect an injured worker's right to compensation or benefits under the Revised Code for which the injured worker otherwise qualifies.
(D) The bureau may order deduction from any living maintenance payment an amount equal to:
(1) One-seventh of the weekly payment to which an injured worker is entitled for each full day during which the injured worker fails, without good cause, to participate in their approved vocational rehabilitation assessment plan or comprehensive vocational rehabilitation plan.
(2) Any wages or other remuneration received by the injured worker while participating in an approved vocational rehabilitation assessment plan or comprehensive vocational rehabilitation plan and receiving living maintenance must either be endorsed over to the bureau, or will be deducted from the injured worker's living maintenance payments or from future awards of compensation.
(E) Living maintenance payments shall not be ordered by the bureau for a period or periods exceeding six months in the aggregate, unless the bureau determines that the injured worker will benefit from an extension of vocational rehabilitation services.
(F) Appeals regarding determination of an injured worker's eligibility for living maintenance payments shall be filed with the bureau within fourteen days of receipt of the bureau's determination.

Once a comprehensive vocational rehabilitation plan is initiated, the MCO shall approve a change in the assigned vocational rehabilitation case manager only for extraordinary circumstances.
(F) The bureau shall determine if living maintenance payments are appropriate and shall monitor all other surplus fund expenditures.
(G) The MCO, in conjunction with the bureau, shall close an injured worker's vocational rehabilitation assessment plan or comprehensive vocational rehabilitation plan for the following objectively determined or identified reasons:

===================================================================



 

4123-18-08 Payment for rehabilitation services and related expenses from the surplus fund.
(A) General principles.
(1) Vocational rehabilitation services and living maintenance when appropriate, shall be paid from the surplus fund, established by section 4123.34 of the Revised Code, so long as such costs are incurred in a lost time claim pursuant to an approved vocational rehabilitation assessment plan, comprehensive vocational rehabilitation plan, or job retention plan.
(2) Vocational rehabilitation services, as mentioned in paragraph (A)(1) of this rule, can include but must not be solely directed toward medical management and allied medical treatment of the injured worker in an approved vocational rehabilitation assessment plan, comprehensive vocational rehabilitation plan, or job retention plan.
(3) Notwithstanding paragraph (A)(1) of this rule, any period of treatment relating to the allowed condition(s) of the claim which has been prescribed and provided prior to the approval of the vocational rehabilitation plan by the physician of record in the claim, by a specialist to whom the injured worker has been referred by the physician of record, the injured worker's employer, the MCO, or the bureau of workers' compensation, and which extends into the calendar period of the injured worker's approved vocational rehabilitation assessment plan, comprehensive vocational rehabilitation plan, or job retention plan shall continue to be charged to the risk of the employer.
(4) Vocational rehabilitation case management costs incurred in the development and preparation of an approved vocational rehabilitation assessment plan, comprehensive vocational rehabilitation plan, or job retention plan, including costs for necessary medical, psychological, and vocational evaluations, are vocational rehabilitation services and are paid from the surplus fund. On-going vocational rehabilitation case management professional services and travel are also paid from the surplus fund while the approved vocational rehabilitation assessment plan, comprehensive vocational rehabilitation plan, or job retention plan is open.
(B) Nonallowed conditions.
(1) The MCO and bureau shall authorize payment for treatment of a condition which is unrelated to the injury or occupational disease as long as it is clearly evident that the unrelated condition is aggravating the industrial injury or occupational disease, preventing healing, impeding vocational rehabilitation, or is a barrier to returning to work. The payment for these conditions shall not exceed two thousand dollars for each claim.
(2) The MCO shall fully document the rationale for these expenditures in both the approved vocational rehabilitation assessment plan, comprehensive vocational rehabilitation plan, or job retention plan and the MCO's rehabilitation case file.
(3) Payment for such treatment shall not constitute a recognition of the unrelated condition as a part of the disability in the claim.
(4) As soon as the unrelated condition is no longer affecting the industrial injury or occupational disease, the responsibility for its treatment ceases and payment for any subsequent treatment that may be given will be injured worker's own responsibility.
(C) Expenses incurred by injured workers.
Travel expenses shall be paid in an approved vocational rehabilitation plan in accordance with rule 4123-6-40 of the Administrative Code, except as additionally provided under the following circumstances:
(1) The bureau may authorize and prepay approved travel expenses.
(2) All bureau approved expenses under this rule shall be paid from the surplus fund established by section 4123.34 of the Revised Code.
(3) Relocation expenses may be paid from the surplus fund. The MCO shall determine the reasonable and necessary costs. These payments may be authorized up to two thousand dollars per injured worker. These costs may be approved when all of the following criteria are met:
(a) Job opportunities for which the injured worker is qualified do not exist within a reasonable commute on a daily basis.
(b) The injured worker has secured a job at the new location as determined by the MCO.
(c) When the criteria under paragraphs (C)(3)(a) and (C)(3)(b) of this rule are satisfied, the bureau may pay relocation expenses with temporary lodging for up to sixty days to find a new residence if the injured worker must sell the injured worker's last place of residence. The relocation expenses may include temporary lodging for up to sixty days.

4123-18-11 Incentive payments to employers who hire or retain injured workers who have completed a rehabilitation program.
The bureau, as a means of encouraging employers to retain, rehire, or hire injured workers who have successfully completed a prescribed rehabilitation program, may make payments to employers from the surplus fund established by section 4123.34 of the Revised Code.
(A) The payments shall be negotiated with the employer and based upon a written agreement signed by the employer and the injured worker, and approved by the bureau. The basis for negotiation shall be:
(1) The nature of the disability of the injured worker as determined by the bureau;
(2) The relationship of the disability to the job requirements; and
(3) The individual merits of the case.
(B) The period(s) of such payment shall not exceed six months in the aggregate, unless the bureau determines that the injured worker would benefit from an extension of payments.
(C) Payments under this rule shall be made directly to the employer on a monthly basis, pursuant to an administrative order of the bureau, provided the employer is a complying employer in the states in which it is subject to workers' compensation coverage requirements or has been accepted by the administrator of workers' compensation as a self-insuring employer under section 4123.35 of the Revised Code. Payments may be made to out-of-state employers who are not subject to the workers' compensation laws of Ohio if a reasonable but unsuccessful effort has been made to secure employment for the injured worker within Ohio. Such payments shall be in amounts stated in the written agreement and shall be charged to the surplus fund established by section 4123.34 of the Revised Code.
(D) The bureau may make incentive payments from the surplus fund to an employer where the employer offers the injured worker paid transitional work activities at the employer's worksite and the employee has completed required medical rehabilitation services and has successfully satisfied vocational rehabilitation readiness requirements. An employee meets vocational rehabilitation readiness requirements when the employee has been officially referred for vocational rehabilitation, is medically stable, and has a significant impediment to a return to full employment.

--->ohio--->Ohio Rules--->Chapter 4123: Bureau of Workers' Compensation--->Chapter 4123-18 Rehabilitation of Injured and Disabled Workers--->4123-18-21 Wage loss payments to injured workers who complete rehabilitation plans.
===================================================================



 

4123-18-21 Wage loss payments to injured workers who complete rehabilitation plans.
(A) For purposes of this rule:
(1) "Successful return to work" as a result of an approved vocational rehabilitation plan means that the injured worker has obtained employment within sixty days of closure of the injured worker's approved comprehensive vocational rehabilitation plan or job retention plan and the employment:
(a) Is within the physical and/or psychiatric limitations caused by the impairments resulting from the allowed conditions in the claim in which the injured worker completed the comprehensive vocational rehabilitation plan or job retention plan, as documented by the injured worker's physician of record; and
(b) Is reasonable in comparison with the return to work goals of the comprehensive vocational rehabilitation plan or job retention plan completed by the injured worker.
(2) "Suitable employment" and "comparably paying work" shall have the same meaning as in rule 4125-1-01 of the Administrative Code.
(B) In claims with a date of injury on or after August 22, 1986, the bureau shall make living maintenance wage loss payments to injured workers who complete an approved comprehensive vocational rehabilitation plan or job retention plan, successfully return to work, and experience a wage loss while employed.
(1) The wage loss must be as a consequence of the physical and/or psychiatric limitations caused by the impairments resulting from the allowed conditions in the claim as documented by the injured worker's physician of record on form MEDCO-14 or equivalent.
(2) Injured workers requesting living maintenance wage loss payments shall be required to submit an application for living maintenance wage loss (on form RH-18 or equivalent) and medical documentation of the physical and/or psychiatric limitations as referenced in paragraph (A)(1) of this rule.
(a) An injured worker must have successfully returned to work as defined in paragraph (A)(1) of this rule to submit an initial application for living maintenance wage loss payments.
(b) Subsequent applications for living maintenance wage loss payments must be submitted by the injured worker before the specified end date of the restrictions provided by the injured worker's physician of record or every six months, whichever occurs first.
(3) Injured workers requesting living maintenance wage loss payments shall not voluntarily limit their income by choosing to work fewer hours or at wages below reasonable expectations, if more appropriate jobs are reasonably available within their labor market. If the injured worker voluntarily limits his or her income by choosing to work fewer hours or by accepting a job which does not constitute suitable employment which is comparably paying work, the injured worker's living maintenance wage loss benefits shall be calculated as sixty-six and two-thirds per cent of the difference between the greater of the injured worker's full weekly wage or average weekly wage on the claim for which the injured worker underwent a rehabilitation plan and the weekly wage the injured worker would have earned had the injured worker not voluntarily limited his or her income.
(a) In determining whether an injured worker has voluntarily limited his or her income, the bureau may review all relevant factors set forth in rule 4125-1-01 of the Administrative Code in determining whether the injured worker has returned to suitable employment which is comparably paying work.
(b) An injured worker who wishes to change jobs after the initial receipt of living maintenance wage loss payments must notify the bureau. The bureau shall review the criteria set forth in paragraph (A)(3)(a) of this rule to ensure that the job the injured worker wishes to change to constitutes suitable employment which is comparably paying work.
(4) In the event the injured worker accepts employment that is below the reasonable expectations of the return to work goals of the vocational rehabilitation plan, or if the injured worker can reasonably be expected to obtain different employment for which earnings are more comparable to those prior to the injury, the injured worker may be required to make a good faith effort to search for suitable employment which is comparably paying work. In determining whether a good faith effort to search for suitable employment is required, the bureau shall consider factors such as the goals of the vocational rehabilitation plan, the labor market, the skills and work history of the injured worker, and any other factors that would assist in determining whether a good faith job search should be required.
(5) To receive living maintenance wage loss payments under this rule after approval of these benefits by the bureau, an injured worker must provide proof of earnings at least every four weeks, or on a quarterly basis if the injured worker has a substantial variation in income, in the form of pay stubs, payroll reports from the injured worker's current employer, or a wage statement on form RH-94(A) or equivalent.
(6) Living maintenance wage loss payments shall be charged to the surplus fund established by section 4123.34 of the Revised Code.
(C) The bureau shall be responsible for calculating living maintenance wage loss payment amounts based upon the information submitted by the injured worker pursuant to paragraph (B)(4) of this rule. Payments shall be sixty-six and two-thirds per cent of the difference between the greater of the injured worker's full weekly wage or average weekly wage on the claim for which the injured worker underwent a rehabilitation plan and the weekly wage received while employed up to a maximum per week equal to the statewide average weekly wage.
(D) Payments may continue for up to a maximum of two hundred weeks but shall be reduced by the corresponding number of weeks in which an injured worker receives payments pursuant to division (B) of section 4123.56 of the Revised Code.
(E) Facts supporting a decision concerning the eligibility or non-eligibility of an injured worker for living maintenance wage loss shall be documented in the bureau's decision. Appeals of living maintenance wage loss eligibility determinations shall be filed with the bureau within fourteen days of receipt of the bureau's determination.

(A) "State risks" are hereby defined as those employers who pay their full premium into the state insurance fund.
(B) "Self-insuring risks" are hereby defined as those employers who are of sufficient financial ability to carry their own insurance; who do not desire to insure the payment thereof, except as provided in division (B) of section 4123.82 of the Revised Code; who secure authority from the administrator of workers' compensation to pay compensation, etc., directly; who pay into the state insurance fund an assessment as established by a rule of the bureau of workers' compensation adopted in accordance with section 111.15 of the Revised Code; who pay to the bureau a contribution to the self-insuring employers' guaranty fund pursuant to section 4123.351 of the Revised Code; and who provide an additional security, where required by the bureau, in the amount or form that may be specified by the bureau.
(C) "Self-insurance" is a privilege granted or denied by the administrator of workers' compensation. Once granted the privilege of self-insurance, the employer determines the first level of a claim and must have employees with a working knowledge of current Ohio workers' compensation law and all rules and regulations of the bureau of workers' compensation and the industrial commission. A self-insuring employer may, without any prior order from the commission or bureau, grant or refuse to grant any claim made under the Ohio Workers' Compensation Act. In granting a claim or awarding payment of compensation or benefits, the employer may provide to its employees compensation or benefits which are greater than those required by law. The employer may not pay compensation or benefits less than that which is required by law.

===================================================================



 

4123-19-03 Where an employer desires to secure the privilege to pay compensation, etc., directly.
(A) All employers granted the privilege to pay compensation directly shall demonstrate sufficient financial strength and administrative ability to assure that all obligations under section 4123.35 of the Revised Code will be met promptly. The administrator of workers' compensation shall deny the privilege to pay compensation, etc., directly, where the employer is unable to demonstrate its ability to promptly meet all the obligations under the rules of the commission and bureau and section 4123.35 of the Revised Code. The administrator shall consider, but shall not be limited to the factors in divisions (B)(1) and (B)(2) of section 4123.35 of the Revised Code where they are applicable in determining the employer's ability to meet all obligations under section 4123.35 of the Revised Code.
The administrator shall review all financial records, documents, and data necessary to provide a full financial disclosure of the employer, including but not limited to, the balance sheets and a profit and loss history for the current year and the previous four years. Unless an applicant obtains waiver under paragraph (E) of rule 4123-19-03.1 of the Administrative Code, financial records submitted to the bureau must be audited by a certified public accountant, in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and shall include the certified public accountant's audit opinion.
(1) The administrator may waive certain requirements of divisions (B)(1) and (B)(2) of section 4123.35 of the Revised Code pursuant to rule 4123-19-03.1 of the Administrative Code.
(2) The administrator shall not grant the status of self-insuring employer to the state, except that the administrator may grant the status of self-insuring employer to a state institution of higher education, including its hospitals.
(B) The employer shall secure from the bureau of workers' compensation proper application form(s) for completion. The completed application shall be filed with the bureau at least ninety days prior to the effective date of the employer's requested status as a self-insurer. The administrator may require that the application be accompanied by an application fee as established by bureau resolution to cover the cost of processing the application in accordance with section 4123.35 of the Revised Code. The application shall not be deemed complete until all required information is attached thereto. Prior to presentation to the administrator, applicable items listed in divisions (B)(1) and (B)(2) of section 4123.35 of the Revised Code shall be made available to the bureau and shall be reviewed by the bureau of workers' compensation. The bureau shall only accept applications which contain the required information.
(C) The bureau shall recognize only such application forms which provide answers to all questions asked and furnish such information as may be required.
(D) Return of the completed forms required by this rule and any additional information required by the bureau to process the employer's application should be submitted at least ninety days prior to the effective date of the employer's requested status as a self-insurer.
(1) If the administrator determines to grant the privilege of self-insurance, the bureau shall issue a "Finding of Facts" statement which has been prepared by the bureau, signed by the administrator, subject to all conditions outlined in paragraph (L)(3) of this rule.
(2) If the administrator determines not to grant the privilege of self-insurance, the bureau shall so notify the employer, whereupon the employer shall be required to continue to pay its full premium into the state insurance fund.
(E) All employers that have secured the privilege to pay compensation, etc., directly, will be required to make contributions as determined by the administrator to the self-insuring employers' guaranty fund established under section 4123.351 of the Revised Code, and, if an additional security is required by the bureau, in the amount or form that may be specified by the bureau. If the additional security is in the form of a surety bond, the bond shall be from a company approved by the bureau and authorized to do business in the state of Ohio by the Ohio department of insurance. The surety bond shall be in the form prescribed by the bureau. The penal amount of such additional security is to be fixed by the administrator.
(F) The surety bond or additional security furnished by the employer shall be for an amount and period as established by the bureau and may be periodically reviewed and reevaluated by the bureau. The surety bond or additional security shall provide on its face that the surety shall be responsible for the payment of all claims where the cause of action, as determined by the date of injury or date of occupational disease, arose during the liability of the surety bond or additional security. The liability under the surety bond or additional security and the rights and obligations of the surety shall be limited to reimbursement for the amounts paid from the surplus accounts of the state insurance fund by reason of the default of the self-insuring employer in accordance with division (B) of section 4123.82 of the Revised Code; however, in the event of such self-insuring employer's default, the bureau shall first seek reimbursement from the surety bond or additional security, which shall be first liable and exhausted, before payment is made from the self-insuring employers' guaranty fund established under section 4123.351 of the Revised Code. Upon default of the self-insuring employer, it shall be the responsibility of the administrator of the bureau of workers' compensation to represent the interests of the state insurance fund and the self-insuring employers' guaranty fund. The administrator, on behalf of the self-insuring employers' guaranty fund, has the rights of reimbursement and subrogation and shall collect from a defaulting self-insuring employer or other liable person all amounts the bureau has paid or reasonably expects to pay from the guaranty fund on account of the defaulting self-insuring employer.
(G) The security herein required to be given by the employer shall be given to the state of Ohio, for the benefit of the disabled or the dependents of killed employees of the employer filing the same, and shall be conditioned for the payment by the employer of such compensation to disabled employees or the dependents of killed employees of such employer, and the furnishing to them of medical, surgical, nursing and hospital attention and services, medicines and funeral expenses equal to or greater than is provided by the Ohio workers' compensation law and for the full compliance with the rules and regulations of the commission and bureau and rules of procedure.
(H) If another or parent corporation or entity owns fifty per cent or more of the stock of an employer, the bureau may, in its discretion, require the employer to furnish a contract of guaranty executed by the ultimate domestic parent corporation or entity. The bureau shall require an alternative form of security if it does not require a contract of guaranty executed by the ultimate domestic parent corporation or entity.
(I) From the effective date of this rule, employees having one or more years of experience as a workers' compensation administrator for a self-insuring employer in Ohio shall be deemed sufficiently competent and knowledgeable to administer a program of self-insurance. Those self-insuring employers that employ workers' compensation administrators who have less than one year of experience as a workers' compensation administrator in Ohio shall not have its status as a self-insuring employer affected pending notification by bureau of workers' compensation as to whether mandatory attendance of the administrator at a bureau of workers' compensation training program is required. If the bureau determines that the administrator is not able to administer a self-insuring program, the bureau may direct mandatory attendance of the administrator at a bureau of workers' compensation training program until such time as the bureau determines that the administrator is sufficiently competent and knowledgeable to run such a workers' compensation program. The cost of the bureau's training of the administrator(s) under this rule will be borne by the self-insuring employer or self-insuring employer applicant. By accepting the privilege of self-insurance, an employer acknowledges that the ultimate responsibility for the administration of workers' compensation claims in accordance with the law and rules of the bureau of workers' compensation and the commission rests with that employer. The self-insuring employer's records and compliance with the bureau of workers' compensation and commission rules shall be subject to periodic audit by the bureau of workers' compensation.
A self-insuring employer or applicant shall designate one of its Ohio employees who is knowledgeable and experienced with the requirements of the Ohio Workers' Compensation Act and rules and regulations therein, as administrator of its self-insuring program. The requirement for an Ohio administrator may be waived at the discretion of the bureau. The name and telephone number of the Ohio administrator, or non-Ohio administrator where the Ohio requisite has been waived, shall be posted by the employer in a prominent place at all the employer's locations. The administrator's duties shall include, but not be limited to:
(1) Acting as liaison between the employer, the bureau of workers' compensation and the commission, and providing information to the agency upon request;
(2) Providing assistance to claimants in the filing of claims and applications for benefits;
(3) Providing information to claimants regarding the processing of claims and the benefits to which claimants may be entitled;
(4) Providing the various forms to be used in seeking compensation or benefits;
(5) Accepting or rejecting claims for benefits;
(6) Approving the payment of compensation and benefits to, or on behalf of, claimants, pursuant to paragraph (K) of this rule.
This rule is not intended to prevent the hiring of an attorney or representative to assist the employer in the handling and processing of workers' compensation claims.
(J) Employers that are granted the privilege of paying compensation, etc., directly, in accordance with these rules and regulations shall file with the bureau a report of paid compensation annually, shall keep a record of all injuries and occupational diseases resulting in more than seven days of temporary total disability or death occurring to its employees and report the same to the bureau upon forms to be furnished by it, and shall observe all the rules and regulations of the commission and bureau and their rules of procedure with reference to determining the amount of compensation, etc., due to the disabled employee or the dependents of killed employees, and payment of the same. All employers granted the privilege of paying compensation, etc., directly shall annually report paid compensation electronically via the bureau's website.
If a self-insured employer fails to timely file its annual report of paid compensation, the bureau may estimate the amount of paid compensation and assess the employer based on this estimate pursuant to rule 4123-17-32 of the Administrative Code. If the employer subsequently provides the bureau with actual paid compensation figures, the bureau shall adjust the paid compensation and any assessment accordingly. A self-insured employer that is no longer a self-insured employer in Ohio and has failed to timely file a report of paid compensation shall be subject to this rule.
(K) Minimal level of performance as a criterion for granting and maintaining the privilege to pay compensation directly.
(1) The employer must be able to furnish or make arrangements for reasonable medical services during all working hours. A written explanation of what arrangements have been made or will be made to provide medical treatment shall be supplied with the application for self-insurance.
For an employer desiring to be first granted the privilege of self-insured status on or after the effective date of this rule, the employer shall provide to the bureau for the bureau's approval the employer's plan for the following:
(a) Criteria for the selective contracting of health care providers;
(b) Plan structure and financial stability for the medical management of claims;
(c) Procedures for the resolution of medical disputes between an employee and the employer, an employee and a provider, or the employer and a provider, prior to an appeal under section 4123.511 of the Revised Code;
(d) Upon the request of the bureau, provide a timely and accurate method of reporting to the administrator necessary information regarding medical and health care service and supply costs, quality, and utilization; and,
(e) Provide an employee the right to change health care providers.
(2) The employer shall promptly pay the fees of outside medical specialists to whom the commission or bureau shall refer claimants for examination or where the commission or bureau refers the claim file for review and opinion by such specialist except as provided by law in cases where the claim was subsequently disallowed. Such fees shall be paid within the time limits provided for payment of medical bills under paragraph (K)(5) of this rule.
(3) Every employer shall keep a record of all injuries and occupational diseases resulting in more than seven days of total disability or death as well as all contested or denied claims and shall report them to the bureau, and to the employee or the claimant's surviving dependents in accordance with rule 4123-3-03 of the Administrative Code.
(4) The employer shall provide to the claimant and upon request, shall file with the bureau or the commission, medical reports relating thereto and received by it from the treating physician and physicians who have seen the claimant in consultation for the allowed injury or occupational disease, or any injury or occupational disease for which a claim has been filed. The claimant shall provide to the employer and, upon request, shall file with the bureau or the commission, medical reports relating thereto and received from the treating physician and physicians who have seen the claimant in consultation for the allowed injury or occupational disease or any injury or occupational disease for which a claim has been filed. The claimant shall honor the employer's request for appropriate written authorization to obtain medical reports to the extent that such reports pertain to the claim.
(5) Within thirty days after receipt of a hospital, medical, nursing or medication bill duly incurred by the claimant, the employer shall either pay such bill, or if the employer contests any of such matters, shall notify the provider, the employee, and, only upon request, the bureau or commission in writing. Such written notice shall specifically state the reason for nonpayment. The employer's notification to the employee shall indicate that the employee has the right to request a hearing before the industrial commission. If the matter is heard by the industrial commission, the employer shall pay compensation and benefits due and payable under an order as provided by section 4123.511 of the Revised Code. If the self-insuring employer allows a claim for benefits or compensation without a hearing, the employer shall pay such benefits or compensation no later than twenty-one days from acquiring knowledge of the claim or the claimant's filing of the C-84 form, whichever is later. The employer shall approve a written request for a change of physicians within seven days of receipt of such request that includes the name of the physician and proposed treatment. The employer shall approve or deny a written request for treatment within ten days of the receipt of the request. If the employer fails to respond to the request, the authorization for treatment shall be deemed granted and payment shall be made within thirty days of receipt of the bill.
(6) The employer shall make its records and facilities available to the employees of the bureau at all reasonable times during regular business hours. A public employer shall make the reports required by section 4123.353 of the Revised Code available for inspection by the administrator of workers' compensation and any other person at all reasonable times during regular business hours.
(7) The employer shall pay all compensation as required by the workers' compensation laws of the state of Ohio. By becoming self-insuring, the employer agrees to abide by the rules and regulations of the bureau and commission and further agrees to pay compensation and benefits subject to the provisions of these rules. The self-insuring employer shall proceed to make payment of compensation or medical benefits without any previous order from the bureau or commission and shall start such payments as required under the Workers' Compensation Act, unless it contests the claim.
(8) The employer may notify the medical section and the claimant at least sixty days prior to the completion of the payment of two hundred weeks of compensation for temporary total disability with the request that the claimant be scheduled for examination by the medical section. Payment of temporary total disability compensation after two hundred weeks shall continue uninterrupted until further order of the commission up to the maximum required by law, unless the claimant has returned to work, or the treating physician has made a written statement that the claimant is capable of returning to his former position of employment or has reached maximum medical improvement or that the disability has become permanent, or, after hearing, an order is issued approving the termination of temporary total disability compensation.
(9) Upon written request by the claimant or claimant's representative, the employer shall make available for review all the employer's records pertaining to the claim. Such review is to be made at a reasonable time (not to exceed seventy-two hours) and place. The claimant, upon written request, shall provide the employer or its representative with an appropriate written authorization to obtain medical reports and records pertaining to the claim.
Except as provided for in this rule, an employer may not assess a fee or charge the claimant or the claimant's representative for the cost of providing a copy of the employer's records pertaining to the claim. Where the employer has previously provided a copy of the record or records pertaining to the claim to the claimant or the claimant's representative, the employer may charge a fee for the copies. The employer's fee shall be based upon the actual cost of furnishing such copies, not to exceed twenty-five cents per page.
(10) The employer shall inform a claimant, and the bureau of workers' compensation, in writing, within thirty days from the filing of the claim, as to what conditions it has recognized as related to the injury or occupational disease and what, if any, it has denied. The same timeframe shall apply when the employer rejects a medical only claim.
(11) The employer shall post notices of its self-insuring status indicating the location in the plant(s) for the filing of a claim and the job title and department of the employees designated by the employer to be the person or persons responsible for the processing of workers' compensation claims.
(12) A public employer, except for a board of county commissioners described in division (G) of section 4123.01 of the Revised Code, a board of a county hospital, or a publicly owned utility, who is granted the status of self-insuring employer pursuant to section 4123.35 of the Revised Code shall comply with the section 4123.353 of the Revised Code.
(L) If a state insurance fund employer or a succeeding employer, as described in rule 4123-17-02 of the Administrative Code, applies for the privilege of paying compensation, etc., directly, by transferring from state fund to self-insurance, the actuary of the bureau shall determine the amount of the liability of such employer to the bureau for its proportionate share of any deficit in the fund. To determine an employer's liability under this rule, the actuary of the bureau shall develop a set of factors to be applied to the pure premium paid by an employer on payroll for a seven year period, as described below. The factors shall be based on the full past experience of the commission and bureau as reflected in the most recent calendar year end audited combined financial statement of the commission and bureau, and shall also accommodate any projected change in the financial condition of the fund for the current calendar year, or any additional period for which an audited combined financial statement is unavailable. The factors shall be revised annually effective July first based on the most recent calendar year audited combined financial statement and the projected change in the financial condition of the fund in the current calendar year or any additional period for which an audited combined financial statement is unavailable. The annually revised factors shall be adopted by rule 4123-17-40 of the Administrative Code, and filed with the secretary of state and the legislative service commission at least ten days prior to July first of each year. Factors effective July first of each year shall apply to all applications for self-insurance filed on or after July first of that year through June thirtieth of the following year. The revised factors shall be applied to the pure premium paid by the employer on payroll for the seven calendar accident years ending December thirty-first of the year preceding the year in which the factors are adopted under rule 4123-17-40 of the Administrative Code. In the event the audited combined financial statement of the commission and bureau reveals that no deficit exists, or in the event the application of the factors adopted by rule 4123-17-40 of the Administrative Code yields a negative number, the employer will incur no liability under this paragraph, but will not receive any refund for prior premiums paid except for those matters specifically addressed in paragraph (L)(2) of this rule. As used in this rule, "pure premium paid" means premiums actually paid under a base rating plan or an experience rating plan and minimum premium paid under a retrospective rating plan. It does not include premiums billed for actual claims costs, including reserves at the end of ten years, under a retrospective rating plan. Obligations under a retrospective rating plan remain the responsibility of the employer regardless of the employer's status. The same principles shall apply to cases of a merger by a self-insuring employer and a state fund employer under the self-insurer's status. In addition, the provisions listed below shall apply:
(1) Within thirty days of the receipt from the employer of the necessary forms and of a separate statement of assets and liabilities, the bureau will forward to the employer a letter stating the amount of liability (if any) due the state fund as outlined above and a copy of the computation of such liability (if any).
(2) Within thirty days of the date of mailing of the letter by the bureau as outlined in paragraph (L)(1) of this rule, the employer shall reply by a letter, signed in handwriting, acknowledging that the employer agrees with the amount of liability specified in the letter and that there are no protests or claims hearings pending which could affect the amount of the liability. If any such matters are pending and would affect the liability, they must be detailed and set forth in the letter from the employer. This letter must also acknowledge that any protest letters, applications for handicap reimbursement or other requests affecting the risk's state fund experience filed subsequent to the date of this letter shall be considered invalid for both rebate of premium on state fund experience and the calculation of liability cited above. This letter must also specify the suggested effective date of the transfer to self-insurance which the employer requests, subject to paragraph (B) of this rule which requires that the effective date must be at least ninety days after the date the application forms are received by the bureau. Failure to comply with the requirements set forth herein shall terminate further consideration of the application.
(3) Subsequent to the approval of the employer's self-insurance status and the effective date thereof by the administrator, the bureau shall issue a settlement sheet statement containing the adjustment required above and billing for an advance deposit as required by other rules of the commission. The employer shall pay the amounts required by this paragraph, pay the contribution to the self-insuring employers' guaranty fund under section 4123.351 of the Revised Code, submit a performance surety bond or additional security, if required by the bureau, and estimated final payroll report as a state fund risk, all within thirty days of the date of the mailing of the self-insured certificate.
(4) The final adjustments of all premiums due the state fund for the final payroll reports and final bureau audit (if any), as well as the pending protests, etc., as specified in paragraph (L)(2) of this rule, shall all be settled and paid within six months from the date of transfer from state fund to self-insuring status. Employer's records must be made available promptly for final audit which must also be completed within six months from the date of the transfer from state risk to self-insurance.
(M) If there is any change involving additions, mergers, or deletions of entities or ownership changes of a self-insuring employer, which would materially affect the administration of the employer's self-insuring employer program or the number of employees included in such program, the employer shall notify the bureau self-insuring employer's section within thirty days after the change occurs. Based upon the information provided or additional information requested by the bureau, the bureau will determine the effect of the change on the employer's self-insuring employer status, the adequacy of the employer's contribution to the self-insuring employers' guaranty fund, and the need for additional security.
(N) If a public employer granted the privilege of self-insurance elects to provide coverage for volunteers and probationers performing services for the political subdivision, the employer shall include such volunteers and probationers as employees to be covered under the self-insurance policy. A public employer's coverage of a "work-relief employee" under Chapter 4127. of the Revised Code shall be included in the public employer's self-insurance policy.

===================================================================



 

4123-19-05 Where an employer is a self-insuring risk and desires to become a state risk.
(A) Where an employer that is a self-insuring risk desires to become a state risk, the employer transferring from a self-insuring risk to a state risk shall be rated at the appropriate experience modifier to the employer's basic premium rate. A self-insuring employer, or a subsidiary, or a part thereof, that returns to the state insurance fund as a state fund employer shall provide the administrator with medical costs and indemnity costs for itself and for any subsidiaries by claim, and payroll by manual classification and year, and any other information as the administrator may require. The self-insuring employer shall submit this information by the date set by the administrator, and in a format determined by the administrator. This information must be submitted each year following the employer's return to the state insurance fund, for as many years as required by the administrator to develop the employer's state fund experience modification factor. The employer may be required to submit additional information to the administrator if the administrator determines that additional information is needed to develop the employer's state fund experience modification factor. The administrator shall use this information to develop a state fund experience modification factor based in whole or in part on the employer's self-insured experience.
(B) Failure to provide the required information will result in assignment of an experience modification factor of two and ineligibility for employer programs for the self-insuring employer that returns to the state insurance fund, until such time as the required information is provided or a state insurance fund experience modification factor is developed based fully on the employer's state insurance fund experience. This provision does not apply to a client employer of a self-finsuring PEO.
(C) The adjustment of the self-insurance premium of such employer shall be computed on an earned premium basis as of the date of transfer from self-insurance to the state fund, which adjustment shall be controlled by the rules controlling the ordinary premium adjustment.
(D) A self-insuring employer that transfers to the state insurance fund shall continue to administer self-insured claims for dates of injury, disease, or death during the period of self-insurance, and the employer shall be responsible to continue to pay compensation and benefits directly. Further, the employer shall remain obligated to pay to the bureau the self-insuring employer assessment calculated on the basis of the paid compensation for such claims attributable to the individual self-insuring employer according the provisions of division (I) of section 4123.35 of the Revised Code and a rule of the bureau of workers' compensation adopted in accordance with section 111.15 of the Revised Code.

Such public hearing shall be conducted before the self-insured review panel in accordance with the provisions of rule 4123-19-14 of the Administrative Code for issues involving the financial strength or the administrative ability of the employer to operate a self-insured workers' compensation program.

===================================================================



 

4123-19-08 Renewal of self-insuring risks.
(A) The privilege of an employer to pay compensation, etc., directly, must be renewed annually. Beginning with the effective date of this rule, prior to renewal of the employer's privilege of self-insurance, the bureau shall re-evaluate the employer's financial strength and administrative ability as described in rule 4123-19-03 of the Administrative Code. The bureau will consider past performance of the self-insuring employer as an additional factor in determining whether to renew the privilege of self-insurance. The five-hundred employee requirement in division (B)(1) of section 4123.35 of the Revised Code will not be considered mandatory in the case of an employer seeking to renew its privilege of self-insurance. Waivers granted for good cause by the administrator pursuant to paragraph (H) of rule 4123-19-03 of the Administrative Code will continue in effect indefinitely unless there is a significant change, in the opinion of the bureau of workers' compensation.
(B) Self-insuring risks desiring to continue paying compensation, etc., directly, shall secure from the bureau a copy of the appropriate form of application which shall be completed and returned to the bureau. The employer may also be required to include a reporting of the amount of payments made and the amount of reserves established for the aforementioned claims as sufficient to cover future liabilities. The properly completed renewal forms shall be signed by the Ohio self-insuring program administrator who has been designated by the employer to the bureau or an officer of the company and filed ninety days prior to the renewal date.
(C) The application forms and the employer's financial statement shall be reviewed by the bureau. In order to renew its status as a self-insuring employer, the employer shall establish the following to the bureau's satisfaction: that the employer has fulfilled the minimal level of performance standards that an employer is required to meet before being granted permission to pay compensation and benefits directly, as provided in paragraph (K) of rule 4123-19-03 of the Administrative Code; that the employer has substantially resolved all outstanding complaints filed with the bureau; and that the employer has achieved a satisfactory rating in its most recent audit report. Upon compliance with these requirements, the administrator may approve the renewal application. If the application is granted, the bureau will so notify the applicant within thirty days prior to the renewal date. In this notification, the bureau shall specify the contribution to the self-insuring employers' guaranty fund and the amount of the additional security, if required.
(D) If the aforesaid employer, upon receipt of such notification, promptly provides the bureau with the security in the amount and form specified by the bureau, the bureau thereafter will issue said employer a revised "Findings of Facts" statement and certificate which will be sent to the risk by the bureau.
(E) In the event the bureau finds that the minimum criteria set forth in the rules have not been met, the bureau shall give written notice to the applicant that the privilege to pay compensation, etc., directly, will not be renewed. Said notice shall give the employer two weeks to exercise the right to a public hearing before the self-insured review panel, in accordance with the provisions of rule 4123-19-14 of the Administrative Code. If no hearing is requested or if the self-insured review panel or, on appeal, the administrator upholds the non-renewal, the applicant shall forthwith be required to pay its full premium into the state insurance fund for the intervening period from the date of the expiration of the last renewal date to the date of the order of non-renewal issued by the self-insured review panel or the administrator, or obtain a binder for state fund coverage as of the expiration date of its last renewal.
(F) If an employer's privilege to pay compensation directly is not renewed, the employer must secure coverage through the state insurance fund for any ongoing operations. If such employer does not secure state fund coverage, that employer shall be deemed an amenable but noncomplying employer pursuant to sections 4123.01 to 4123.99 of the Revised Code.
(G) If, for any reason, it is not possible to finally pass on the employer's application for renewal prior to the expiration of its present authorization, an extension may be granted until such time as the final disposition of the application for renewal can be made.

===================================================================



 

4123-19-09 In regard to complaints filed by employees against self-insuring employers under the provisions of section 4123.35 of the Revised Code.
(A) The bureau shall receive all complaints concerning any employer engaged in paying compensation directly to its employees. The bureau shall transfer to the self-insuring employers evaluation board only those complaints which are not resolved. An employer shall respond in writing to a complaint within fourteen days of receipt thereof, and the employer's response shall be made a part of the complaint file.
(B) The administrator of the bureau of workers' compensation shall investigate and process all complaints against a self-insuring employer through the self-insuring employers section of the bureau. However, the bureau may dismiss a complaint based upon the employer's action or lack of action with respect to events that occurred more than two years prior to the filing of the complaint, unless the facts could not have been reasonably known to the claimant.
(C) The bureau shall maintain a file by employers of all complaints that relate to the employer, together with any information filed by the employer as to such complaints. A copy of all complaints shall become a part of the self-insuring employer's record file and shall be available at the time of renewal consideration. The bureau shall evaluate each complaint and take appropriate action as follows:
(1) If the bureau records for such employee does not contain full information as to the matter which is the subject of the complaint, the bureau may attempt to obtain such information by correspondence with the self-insuring employer, the claimant, and their authorized representatives, if any.
(2) The bureau may also audit the program of the employer in the manner provided in section 4123.35 of the Revised Code.
(D) Following receipt of all necessary information, including bureau records, correspondence from the employee and the employer, or an audit by the bureau of workers' compensation, the bureau may dismiss the complaint as invalid or find that the complaint has been resolved. Any unresolved complaint against a self-insuring employer shall be referred to the self-insuring employers evaluation board for further action in accordance with the provisions of rule 4123-19-13 of the Administrative Code. If the bureau determines that a complaint is invalid or resolved and decides not to present the complaint to the self-insuring employers evaluation board, the claimant may request that the complaint be presented to the administrator or the self insuring employers evaluation board for further consideration.
(E) Complaints referred to the bureau as provided above shall be retained in the employer's file for the period of four years from the date of resolution.
(F) No employer that elects to pay compensation directly shall harass, dismiss or otherwise discipline any employee for making a complaint. Upon receipt of this information that such harassment, dismissal or other disciplinary action has been taken, the bureau shall assign the matter for hearing pursuant to the provisions of rule 4123-19-13 of the Administrative Code before the members of the self-insuring employers evaluation board. If the board finds that such employer is guilty of harassing, dismissing or otherwise disciplining the claimant for making the complaint, the board shall levy a reasonable financial penalty under the circumstances as the board deems appropriate, payable by the employer to the surplus fund.
(G) Repeated violations of this rule shall be grounds for revocation of the employer's privilege to pay compensation, etc., directly.

===================================================================



 

4123-19-15 Assessment for self-insuring employers' guaranty fund.
(A) The bureau of workers' compensation shall require self-insuring employers to pay a contribution to the self-insuring employers' guaranty fund as provided in this rule. The contributions due from self-insuring employers shall be established at rates as low as possible but such as will ensure sufficient monies to guarantee the payment of any claims against the fund. All self-insuring employers who are paying compensation as defined by division (L) of section 4123.35 of the Revised Code, whether active or inactive as a self-insuring employer, are required to pay a contribution to the self-insuring employers' guaranty fund as provided in this rule.
(B) The bureau shall maintain a minimum balance of funds in the self-insuring employers' guaranty fund of one and a quarter times the prior year's payments from the fund as determined at the end of each calendar year to ensure sufficient monies to guarantee the payment of any claims against the fund. When the bureau determines that there are insufficient funds in the guaranty fund and an assessment is necessary to ensure the minimum balance in the fund, the bureau shall assess all self-insuring employers an annual contribution as determined by the administrator to maintain the minimum balance. Annual contributions will not be assessed to all self-insuring employers when the bureau determines that the fund exceeds the minimum amount necessary to guarantee the payment of any claims against the fund, except as provided in paragraph (C) of this rule.
(C) In addition to any contribution required of all self-insuring employers as provided in paragraph (B) of this rule, the contribution to the self-insuring employers' guaranty fund shall be as follows:
(1) New self-insuring employers, for each of the first three years of self-insurance, shall be assessed six per cent of base rate premium as reported on the total of the last two full six-month semi-annual payroll reports submitted as a subscriber to the state insurance fund. This assessment shall not apply to entities added to the coverage of an existing self-insuring risk after the first three years of self-insurance of the existing risk.
(2) A self-insuring employer identified as a high risk employer by the bureau shall be assessed six per cent of the previous year's paid compensation as reported to the bureau or shall be required to provide appropriate security as defined in paragraph (A)(1)(c) of rule 4123-19-03 of the Administrative Code.
The assessment shall not be less than five thousand dollars for any twelve-month period of coverage. All annual premiums to the self-insuring employers' guaranty fund are due and shall be collected within forty-five days from the receipt of the bureau's invoice. Self-insuring employers not making timely payments shall be subject to revocation of self-insuring employer status.
(D) As used in this rule, the bureau shall determine whether a self-insuring employer is a "high risk" employer based upon a review of the self-insuring employer's certified financial records submitted with the application for self-insuring employer renewal. The bureau's analysis and determination may include, but is not limited to, a review of the self-insuring employer's equity to debt ratio, return on equity, Z-score, and a Moody's rating, or other nationally recognized financial rating of the long term stability of a company.

--->ohio--->Ohio Rules--->Chapter 4123: Bureau of Workers' Compensation--->Chapter 4123-19 General Procedures for State Insurance Fund; Self-Insuring Employers--->4123-19-16 Self-insured construction projects.
===================================================================



 

4123-19-16 Self-insured construction projects.
(A) As used in this rule:
(1) "Responsible self-insured employer" or "responsible employer" means the self-insuring employer or the public school employer that enters into a construction contract and applies for permission to self-insure the construction contract. The responsible employer is the entity responsible for the cost of the construction project and generally will be the owner of the project. The responsible employer is the payor under the contract.
"Responsible self-insured employer" or "responsible employer" may include a self-insured general contractor or construction manager whose principal source of business is the execution of construction projects.
(2) "Public school employer" means an employer defined in division (R) of section 4123.35 of the Revised Code that enters into a construction contract exceeding twenty five million dollars and applies for permission to self-insure the construction contract, whether or not the employer is a self-insuring employer.
(3) "General contractor" means a self-insured employer that has entered into a contract with an owner to perform more than fifty per cent, by value, of the work on a construction project.
(4) "Construction manager" means a self-insured employer that has entered into a contract with an owner to provide substantially the same services described in division (A) of section 9.33 of the Revised Code in connection with a construction project. Regardless of any contrary terms of section 9.33 of the Revised Code, for purposes of this rule, the term "construction manager" is not limited to public projects and may apply even if the construction manager also performs construction work on the project.
(5) "Contracting employer" or "subcontracting employer" means any employer, whether state fund or self-insured, that has contracted either directly with a responsible self-insuring employer or with a contracting or subcontracting employer to perform construction services on the construction project. The contracting employer is the payee under the contract, except for where the contracting employer has subcontracted with another contracting employer.
(B) The purpose of this rule is to establish standards by which the administrator may permit a responsible self-insuring employer to self-insure a construction project entered into by the responsible self-insuring employer pursuant to division (O) of section 4123.35 of the Revised Code.
(C) The administrator's authority to grant self-insured status for a construction project is permissive. The bureau of workers' compensation may establish criteria for granting self-insured status to ensure the financial stability and claims continuity of the workers' compensation program. The burden of proof is on the responsible self-insured employer to satisfy the requirements of divisions (O), (P), and (Q) of section 4123.35 of the Revised Code, including designation of a safety professional and employment of an ombudsperson for the construction project, and such other requirements as the administrator may establish by this rule or other policy for granting permission to self-insure a construction project.
(D) A responsible employer filing an application to self-insure a construction project shall be a self-insuring employer under the Ohio workers' compensation statutes, except that a public school employer may be a state fund employer. A public school employer shall be self-insured for the construction project only and shall maintain state fund coverage for its employees.
(E) In order for a responsible employer to be considered for self-insurance under division (O) of section 4123.35 of the Revised Code, the responsible employer must submit an application including, but not limited to, the following information:
(1) Dates the construction project is scheduled to begin and end, including the site(s) of the construction project;
(2) The estimated cost of the project;
(3) The contracting and subcontracting employers whose employees are to be self-insured by the responsible employer, including estimated payroll (any changes to the list of contracting and subcontracting employers during the duration of the project shall be sent to the bureau within two business days);
(4) The provisions of a safety program specifically designed for the project;
(5) A statement as to whether a collective bargaining agreement governing the rights, duties, and obligations of each of the parties to the agreement with respect to the project exists between the self-insuring employer and a labor organization.
(6) All applications must be submitted ninety days prior to the desired effective date.
The administrator may require other information as needed to aid in the decision-making process.
(F) If the administrator approves the application, the administrator shall mail to the responsible self-insured employer a certificate granting the privilege to self-insure the construction project. Upon approval, the responsible employer is responsible for the administration and payment for the life of the claim of all claims under Chapters 4121. and 4123. of the Revised Code for the employees of any contracting employers and subcontracting employers covered under the certificate who receive injuries or are killed in the course of and arising out of employment on the project, or who contract an occupational disease in the course of employment on the project.
(G) The responsible employer is entitled to all of the protections provided under Chapters 4121. and 4123. of the Revised Code with respect to the employees of the contracting and subcontracting employers covered under the certificate as if the employees were employees of the responsible employer.
(H) The contracting and subcontracting employers included under the certificate are entitled to the protections provided under Chapters 4121. and 4123. of the Revised Code with respect to the contracting and subcontracting employer's employees who are employed on the construction project which is the subject of the certificate.
(I) The contracting and subcontracting employers included under the certificate shall identify in their payroll records for audit and compliance purposes the employees who are considered the employees of the responsible employer listed in that certificate for purposes of Chapters 4121. and 4123. of the Revised Code, and the amount that those employees earned from employment on the project that is subject to the certificate. The contracting or subcontracting employer shall exclude the payroll for its employees under the construction project from its payroll report and the administrator shall not consider the payroll when determining those contracting or subcontracting employers' premiums or assessments required under Chapters 4121. and 4123. of the Revised Code.
(J) The responsible employer shall include in the amount of paid compensation it reports pursuant to division (L) of section 4123.35 of the Revised Code, the amount of paid compensation that the responsible employer paid pursuant to division (O) of section 4123.35 of the Revised Code.
(K) For a public school employer, the bureau may grant the privilege of participating as a self-insured employer for a construction project under this rule on a one year basis, and shall consider the project for renewal annually pursuant to rule 4123-19-08 of the Administrative Code.
(1) Surety bond or letter of credit.
(a) A public school employer shall be required to make contributions as determined by the administrator to the self-insuring employers' guaranty fund established under section 4123.351 of the Revised Code.
In addition, the employer shall provide additional security as required by the bureau in the amount or form that may be specified by the bureau. At a minimum, the additional security shall be one hundred and twenty-five per cent of the expected workers' compensation losses of the construction project as determined by the bureau. The security shall be in force on or before the administrator grants the privilege to self-insure the construction project. In the event the initial calculation of expected losses is shown to be less than the actual losses, additional security shall be provided as required by the bureau.
(b) The public school employer shall assign the additional security required by this rule to the bureau for the benefit of the disabled employees or the dependents of killed employees of the public school employer for the construction project. In addition, the security shall be applied to disabled workers' relief fund payments to employees of the construction project and administrative expenses of the bureau in the management of such claims of employees of the construction project.
(c) Notwithstanding the authority of the bureau to seek reimbursement from the self insuring employers' guaranty fund, or from surety, excess loss insurance, and any other sources provided by the employer, the legal obligation to pay the costs of injuries, occupational diseases, and deaths incurred under the construction project remains with the public school employer.
(2) Disabled workers relief fund.
A public school employer shall be required to pay the ultimate costs of disabled workers relief fund payments to employees of the construction project, no matter the status of the construction project at the time the disabled workers relief fund payments are made to the employees of the construction project.
(3) Excess loss insurance.
A public school employer may purchase excess loss insurance subject to the rules applying to self-insuring employers. In the event the excess loss insurance is purchased, all rights to recovery from that insurance must be assignable to the bureau in the event of bankruptcy of the public employer school facility employer.
(4) Reducing the costs of the construction project.
As a condition precedent to the bureau granting the privilege to self-insure the construction project, a public school employer shall certify to the bureau by a written document signed by the highest elected official(s) of the employer, the costs savings of self insuring the construction project. The certification shall include data as required by the bureau, including but not limited to a cost analysis showing the costs of insuring the project with the Ohio state insurance fund and the costs of self insuring the project.
(5) Safety plan.
A safety professional shall be assigned to each construction project. The safety professional shall be responsible for ensuring that activities are performed in accordance with the site-specific health and safety plan ("HASP") and training of site personnel.
A site-specific "HASP" shall be created prior to the start of the project and shall, at a minimum, contain the following elements:
(a) Identify all recognized site hazards associated with each phase of the project. Particular attention should be given to fall hazards, trenching operations, and electrical hazards.
(b) Identify key personnel and alternates responsible for site safety and health and the appointment of a site safety and health officer. Roles and responsibilities must be defined.
(c) Evaluate the risks associated with each operation and identify the appropriate control measures to be taken to minimize or eliminate those risks.
(d) Address training requirements for both routine and non-routine activities.
(e) Include contingencies in the "HASP." Contingencies may include: communications (internal and external), first aid provisions and providers, identification of nearest medical facility, post emergency phone numbers, and site control (prevent access by unauthorized personnel).
(f) Include employee involvement, such as involvement in inspections, incident investigations, and hazard analyses.
(g) Collect documentation of information, such as hazard inspections, audits of the "HASP," injury/illness data, incident investigations, industrial hygiene surveys, maintenance records, and job hazard analyses.
(6) Organizational Plan Criteria.
The public school employer shall:
(a) Identify a self-insured program administrator to be knowledgeable in the rules and laws of Ohio self-insurance for workers' compensation;
(b) Identify its plan to obtain timely payroll information for all contractors and subcontractors covered, to ensure timely calculation and distribution of injured worker benefits; its methodology for payment of compensation and medical fee bills; and its method of educating each contractor and its employers as to proper claim reporting and access to medical care procedures;
(c) Designate where claim files will be located;
(d) Provide to the bureau for the bureau's approval the employer's plan for medical management of claims as required by paragraph (K)(1) of rule 4123-19-03 of the Administrative Code;
(e) Plan to ensure accurate accounting of workers covered under the construction project;
(f) Identify the bank being used for the workers' compensation account.
(7) Ombudsperson duties.

(a) Have experience in workers' compensation or the construction industry, or both.
(b) Communicate with and provide information to employees who are injured in the course of, and arising out of, employment on the construction project.
(c) Investigate the status of a claim upon the request of an employee.

Payment of a renewal premium prior to the stated expiration date shall be effective to continue the coverage of the insured without lapse.
(D) Payment of a renewal premium after the expiration date shall be ineffective to continue the coverage of the insured employer without lapse. If an insured employer tenders payment of a renewal premium after the stated expiration date, the administrator may, in the administrator's discretion, reinstate the coverage of such employer as of the date of receipt of payment or require the employer to submit a new application for subscription to the marine industry fund. In no event shall retroactive coverage be granted with respect to any period when the coverage of an insured employer has lapsed.

4123-20-03 Premium payment.
(A) Except as otherwise provided in this rule, premiums for marine industry fund insurance coverage shall be payable in advance, in semiannual installments, at a rate determined by the administrator of workers' compensation, subject to the approval of the bureau of workers' compensation board of directors. The amount of prepaid premium for any six-month period shall be determined by applying the rates and manuals in use by the marine industry fund for such period to the estimated payroll of the insured for a period of eight months.
(B) The initial premium required for the issuance of a new marine industry fund insurance policy shall be a sum equal to the estimated premium obligation for a period of eight months. Payment of the initial premium shall secure to the insured coverage for the remainder of the six month period from the date of issuance of the policy plus a two month adjustment period.
(C) Beginning July 1, 2012, renewal premiums shall be due and payable no later than August thirty-first (for the January first to June thirtieth period) and the last day of February (for the July first to December thirty-first period) . The premium required to renew a marine industry fund insurance policy shall be the prepaid premium for the next renewal period, determined in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (A) of this rule.
(D) All prepaid premiums shall be subject to adjustment at or after the close of the period with respect to which such prepaid premium was submitted. Adjustments shall be based on the employer's report of his actual payroll for the period, or upon audit findings reported by the authorized agents of the marine industry fund. In the event that adjustment of the prepaid premium reveals that the insured has overpaid his premium for the period being adjusted, the insured shall be entitled to reduce his renewal premium by the amount of such overpayment, or the insured shall be entitled to a refund. Should the adjustment reveal that the prepaid premium was less than the premium obligation based on actual payroll for the period being adjusted, the additional premium found to be owing shall be added to the renewal premium, or shall be billed to the employer.

4123-20-04 Payroll reporting.
(A) All employers insured by the marine industry fund shall, at such intervals as may be required by the fund, submit payroll reports showing the number of persons employed in occupations covered by the marine industry fund insurance policy and the total payroll allocable to each manual classification in use by the marine industry fund and applicable to the insured.
(B) In July and January of each year, the marine industry fund shall mail the insured a report form. The insured shall return such form, together with any adjustment premiums and renewal premiums then due, to the fund no later than August thirty-first and not later than the last day of February, for the respective payroll periods. Such report shall include a statement of the insured's actual payroll allocable to each appropriate manual classification for the prior six months, and an estimate of the insured's anticipated payroll for the ensuing eight months, and such other information as shall be required by the fund.
(C) The payroll reports provided for in paragraph (B) of this rule shall be used as the basis for adjustment of premiums paid for the prior period, and for determination of the prepaid premium for the ensuing period. No provision of this rule shall be construed to limit in any way the right of the fund to audit the payroll records of the insured or to make adjustments based on the findings of such audits.
(D) In the event that the actual payroll for any six-month reporting period is greater than ninety per cent of the eight-month estimated payroll, the insured employer shall be subject to a penalty in the sum of ten per cent of the total premium due for such six-month period. The penalty provided for herein shall not apply, if the insured employer shall promptly notify the marine industry fund of any increase in payroll expenditures beyond the level of previously reported estimated payroll, and submit payment of additional premium to cover such increased payroll, prior to the end of the six-month reporting period.
(E) Pursuant to section 4131.14 of the Revised Code, for all payroll periods beginning July 1, 2012, if the employer estimates no payroll or calculates estimated premium of less than the minimum administrative charge for the reporting period, the employer shall pay a minimum annual non-refundable administrative charge at a rate of fifty dollars each six months or one hundred dollars annually.

(F) The remuneration of employees whose duties are exclusively of a non-maritime character shall not be reported to the marine industry fund.

4123-21-03 Premium payment.
(A) Premiums for coal-workers' pneumoconiosis insurance coverage shall be payable in semiannual installments. When the initial application for coverage is received and accepted, the applicant shall be billed based upon its estimated payroll reported to the bureau of workers' compensation for state insurance fund purposes in appropriate job classifications.
(B) The initial premium required for issuance of a new coal-workers' pneumoconiosis fund insurance policy shall be an advance deposit sufficient to cover premiums for an eight-month period. After every payroll reporting period, this advance premium deposit shall be reviewed for adequacy. If the current deposit is not sufficient, the company shall be billed for the difference. If the current deposit is more than required, a refund shall be made to the subscriber for the difference.
(C) Renewal premiums shall be due and payable sixty days after the expiration of the last semiannual period for which prepaid premium has been submitted. Provided, however, that to prevent the notice of impending cancellation required by paragraph (B) of rule 4123-21-07 of the Administrative Code, payment must be received no later than thirty days after the expiration date referred to above. The premium required for renewal for the next semiannual period shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of paragraphs (A) and (B) of this rule. However, the administrator of workers' compensation, subject to the approval of the bureau of workers' compensation board of directors, may by resolution establish a minimum semiannual premium, payment of which shall be a condition to continuation of coverage.
(D) A subscriber whose required advance premium deposit is over three thousand dollars may satisfy the provisions of this rule by submitting a surety bond for the amount over three thousand dollars. The first three thousand dollars, however, must be deposited in cash. Surety bonds provided for in this rule shall be renewed annually, based upon the subscriber's current requirements.
(E) Upon cancellation of coverage other than by default, any premiums due through the date of cancellation shall be deducted from the advance premium deposit and the balance shall be refunded to the former subscriber.
(F) A subscriber to the coal-workers' pneumoconiosis fund who ceases operations in the extraction, transportation, or processing of coal but continues as a business entity, may retain coal-workers' pneumoconiosis fund coverage by the continued payments of premiums at reduced rates, depending on the number of years of non-operating subscription. The administrator, subject to the approval of the bureau of workers' compensation board of directors, shall periodically fix the method of computation of such reduced premiums by rule.

Chapter 4123:1-1 Elevators
4123:1-1-01 Scope and definitions.
(A) Scope.
The purpose of this chapter of the Administrative Code is to provide reasonable safety for life, limb and health of employees.
The specific requirements of this chapter are requirements for the protection of employees of an employer who has the possession of an elevator through ownership, lease or other property right under which said employer has continuous control of and responsibility for the operation of the elevator. This chapter does not afford protection requirements for employees of elevator manufacturers, installers or inspectors while any such employee is working on premises not in the legal possession of such employee's own employer or for employees of an employer other than the type described in the preceding sentence. The requirements of this chapter apply to all elevators that fall within the term "elevator", as that term is defined in division (A) of section 4105.01 of the Revised Code.
Other chapters of the Administrative Code of specific safety requirements adopted by the Ohio bureau of workers' compensation may be applicable to some or all items related to some types of elevators. To the extent that any such other chapter may conflict with the requirements of this chapter, this chapter shall prevail. Where conflict does not exist, such other chapter shall be deemed to establish specific safety requirements that are supplementary to those contained in this chapter. The requirements of this chapter apply to elevators, whether installed, rebuilt or changed before or after the effective date hereof.

4123:1-1-02 Certificate of operation.
(A) Reserved.
(B) Reserved.
(C) As required by Chapter 4105. of the Revised Code and the rules promulgated thereunder, no elevator of an employer may be operated without a currently valid certificate of operation, issued by the Ohio department of commerce, divisions of industrial compliance or similar authorization issued by a municipality having jurisdiction to do so. In the absence of a currently valid certificate or authorization, an injury or death of an employee incurred by reason of an elevator of the employer shall be presumed to be due to the violation of this specific safety requirement. Such presumption may be rebutted if the employer shows that the absence of the certificate or authorization was due to factors beyond the control of the employer for one or more of the following reasons:
(1) The inspecting authority, with knowledge of the existence of the elevator, had failed to inspect it, which knowledge may be shown by
(a) Evidence of express notice having been forwarded to the appropriate authority,
(b) Evidence that a certificate or other authorization had been issued in the past for such elevator,
(c) Evidence from the files of the appropriate authority or,
(d) Other competent evidence demonstrating such knowledge by the appropriate authority;
Provided however, that no such authority shall be found to have had knowledge of the existence of an elevator after the elevator has once been taken out of service, except for maintenance or minor repairs. An elevator operated after having been so taken out of service and before it has been inspected by the appropriate authority shall be a violation of this specific safety requirement and the presumption prescribed above shall apply.
(2) The inspecting authority had inspected the elevator, approved it and the certificate of operation or other authorization had not been received by the employer.
(3) The inspecting authority had inspected the elevator and no deficiency noted in the inspection report contributed to the injury or death.

   (3) "Derrick, basket" means a derrick without a boom, similar to a gin pole, with its base supported by ropes attached to corner posts or other parts of the structure. The base is at a lower elevation than its supports. The location of the base of a basket derrick can be changed by varying the length of the rope supports. The top of the pole is secured with multireeved guys to position the top of the pole to the desired location. By varying the length of the upper guy lines, the load is raised and lowered by ropes through the sheave or block secured to the top of the pole.
   (4) "Derrick, breast" means a derrick without a boom, the mast consisting of two side members spread farther apart at the base than at the top, tied together at the top and bottom by rigid members, the top held from tipping by guys and the load raised and lowered by ropes through a sheave or block secured to the top crosspieces.
   (5) "Derrick, Chicago boom" means an ordinary derrick boom so installed as to utilize a building column or tower hoist as the mast, and to depend upon the structural steel beam connections or bracing to take the place of the stiff legs. The lower end of the boom is attached to the building columns by means of a combination hinge pin and swivel pin to a heavy steel plate clamp attached to the column. The derrick is completed with load fall line and boom fall line.
   (6) "Derrick, gin pole" means a derrick consisting only of a mast with guys so arranged as to permit leaning the mast in any direction, the load being raised or lowered by ropes leading through sheaves or blocks at the top of the mast.
   (7) "Derrick, guy" means a fixed derrick consisting of a mast capable of being rotated, supported in a vertical position by three or more guys and a boom whose bottom end is hinged or pivoted to move in a vertical plane, with lines between the head of the mast and the head of the boom for raising and lowering the boom lines from the head of the boom for raising and lowering the load.
   (8) "Derrick, stiff leg" means a derrick similar to a guy derrick except that the mast is supported or held in place by two or more stiff members capable of resisting either tensile or compressive forces. Sills are generally provided to connect the lower ends of the two stiff legs to the foot of the mast.
   (9) "Derrick, tripod" means a derrick consisting of three upright legs or members securely fastened together at the top, supporting a hoisting mechanism and operating ropes. The legs can be spread to various angles.
   (10) "Hoist, mast" means a hoist having no less than two upright parallel members forming the mast, on which the cage is suspended outside of the parallel members. The entire unit is portable, but not self-propelled.

4123:1-3-08 Ropes, chains and slings.
(A) Reserved.
   (B) Reserved.
   (C) General requirements.
   (1) Working loads.
   Ropes, chains and slings shall not be used in excess of their safe working load.
(2) Factor of safety - component parts.
   All connections, fittings, fastenings, parts, etc., used in connection with manila ropes, wire ropes or chains shall be of such quality and strength and so attached, connected, fastened, etc., as to provide a factor of safety of no less than the carrying agent for which they are designed.
(3) Limitation on wire rope.
   Haulage rope shall not be provided for use as a hoisting rope.
(4) Clearance.
   The ratio between the rope diameter and the block, sheave or pulley tread diameter shall be such as to allow the rope strands to slide past each other and adjust themselves to the bend. In no case shall the sheave diameter be less than that recommended in the manufacturer's specifications for corresponding block, sheave and pulley diameters. Sheaves or pulleys with eccentric bores or with cracked hubs, spokes or flanges shall be repaired or removed from service.
(5) Protection.
   Where manila rope or wire rope is used to support equipment and is brought over a sharp corner of steel, stone or other material liable to cut or cause undue abrasion to the manila rope or wire rope, it shall be protected at such points by the use of bagging, wooden blocks or other protective padding.
(6) Manila rope prohibited.
   Manila rope slings shall not be used for handling known acid- or caustic-contaminated material or objects.
(7) Use of chain prohibited.
   The use of chain as a sling or choker in erection of steel is prohibited.
(D) Alloy steel chains.
   (1) Welded alloy steel chain slings shall have permanently affixed durable identification stating size, grade, rated capacity, and sling manufacturer.
   (2) Hooks, rings, oblong links, pear-shaped links, welded or mechanical coupling links, or other attachments, when used with alloy steel chains, shall have a rated capacity at least equal to that of the chain.
   (3) Job or shop hooks and links, makeshift fasteners, made from bolts, rods, etc., or other such attachments shall not be used.
(4) Whenever wear at any point of any chain link exceeds that shown in "Table 8-1," the assembly shall be removed from service.

*These values only apply when the D/Zd ratio is 20 or greater where:
D = Diameter of curvature around which the body of the sling is bent.
d = Diameter of component rope.
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 (5) When U-bolt wire rope clips are used to form eyes, "Table 8-2" shall be used to determine the number of clips and the amount of rope to turn back. Spacing of clips shall be uniform between the loop and the dead end. When used for eye splices, the U-bolt shall be applied so that the "U" section is in contact with the dead end of the rope.
 

 
 

 

   (F) Natural rope, and synthetic fiber.
(1) General.
Employers must not use natural-fiber and synthetic-fiber rope slings with loads in excess of the rated capacities (i.e., working load limits) indicated on the sling by permanently affixed and legible identification markings prescribed by the manufacturer.

   (2) All splices in rope slings provided by the employer shall be made in accordance with fiber rope manufacturers' recommendations.
(a) In manila rope, eye splices shall contain no less than three full tucks, and short splices shall contain no less than six full tucks (three on each side of the centerline of the splice).
(b) In layed synthetic fiber rope, eye splices shall contain no less than four full tucks, and short splices shall contain no less than eight full tucks (four on each side of the centerline of the splice).
(c) Strand end tails shall not be trimmed short (flush with the surface of the rope) immediately adjacent to the full tucks. This precaution applies to both eye and short splices and all types of fiber rope. For fiber ropes under one-inch diameter, the tails shall project no less than six rope diameters beyond the last full tuck. For fiber ropes one-inch diameter and larger, the tails shall project no less than six inches beyond the last full tuck. In applications where the projecting tails may be objectionable, the tails shall be tapered and spliced into the body of the rope using no less than two additional tucks (which will require a tail length of approximately six rope diameters beyond the last full tuck).
(d) For all eye splices, the eye shall be sufficiently large to provide an included angle of no greater than sixty degrees at the splice when the eye is placed over the load or support.
(e) Knots shall not be used in lieu of splices.

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

   (G) Synthetic webbing (nylon, polyester and polypropylene).
   (1) The employer shall have each synthetic web sling marked or coded to show:
   (a) Name or trademark of manufacturer.
   (b) Rated capacities for the type of hitch.
   (c) Type of material.
(2) Rated capacity shall not be exceeded.
(H) Shackles and hooks.
   (1) Employers must not use shackles with loads in excess of the rated capacities (i.e., working load limits) indicated on the shackle by permanently affixed and legible identification markings prescribed by the manufacturer.
   (2) The manufacturer's recommendations shall be followed in determining the safe working loads of the various sizes and types of specific and identifiable hooks. All hooks for which no applicable manufacturer's recommendations are available shall be tested to twice the intended safe working load before they are initially put into use.

Taken from

U.S. Navy Diving Manual
Prepared by
National Association of Underwater Instructors
Table 1-9.- Decompression procedures
General Instructions for Air Diving
Need for Decompression
A quantity of nitrogen is taken up by the body during every dive. The amount absorbed depends upon the depth of the dive and the exposure (bottom) time. If the quantity of nitrogen dissolved in the body tissues exceeds a certain critical amount, the ascent must be delayed to allow the body tissue to remove the excess nitrogen. Decompression sickness results from failure to delay the ascent and to allow this process of gradual desaturation. A specified time at a specific depth for purposes of desaturation is called a decompression stop.
No-Decompression Schedules
Dives that are not long or deep enough to require decompression stops are no-decompression dives. Dives to 33 feet or less do not require decompression stops. As the depth increases, the allowable bottom time for no-decompression dives decreases. Five minutes at 190 feet is the deepest no-decompression schedule. These dives are all listed in the No-Decompression Limits and Repetitive Group Designation Table for No-Decompression Dives (No-Decompression Table (table 1-11)), and only require compliance with the 60-feet-per-minute rate of ascent.
Schedules That Require Decompression Stops
All dives beyond the limits of the No-Decompression Table require decompression stops. These dives are listed in the Navy Standard Air Decompression Table (table 1-10). Comply exactly with instructions except as modified by surface decompression procedures.
Variations in Rate of Ascent
Ascend from all dives at the rate of 60 feet per minute.
In the event you are unable to maintain the 60-feet-per-minute rate of ascent:
(a) If the delay was at a depth greater than 50 feet: increase the bottom time by the difference between the time used in ascent and the time that should have been used at a rate of 60 feet per minute.
Decompress according to the requirements of the new total bottom time.
(b) If the delay was at a depth less than 50 feet: increase the first stop by the difference between the time used in ascent and the time that should have been used at the rate of 60 feet per minute.
Repetitive Dive Procedure
A dive performed within 12 hours of surfacing from a previous dive is a repetitive dive. The period between dives is the surface interval. Excess nitrogen requires 12 hours to be effectively lost from the body. These tables are designed to protect the diver from the effects of this residual nitrogen. Allow a minimum surface interval of 10 minutes between all dives. For any interval under 10 minutes, add the bottom time of the previous dives to that of the repetitive dive and choose the decompression schedule for the total bottom time and the deepest dive. Specific instructions are given for the use of each table in the following order:
(1) The No-Decompression Table or the Navy Standard Air Decompression Table gives the repetitive group designation for all schedules which may precede a repetitive dive.
(2) The Surface Interval Credit Table gives credit for the desaturation occurring during the surface interval.
(3) The Repetitive Dive Timetable gives the number of minutes of residual nitrogen time to add to the actual bottom time of the repetitive dive to obtain decompression for the residual nitrogen.
(4) The No-Decompression Table or the Navy Standard Air Decompression Table gives the decompression required for the repetitive dive.
U.S. Navy Standard Air Decompression Table
Instructions for Use
Time of decompression stops in the table is in minutes.
Enter the table at the exact or the next greater depth than the maximum depth attained during the dive. Select the listed bottom time that is exactly equal to or is next greater than the bottom time of the dive. Maintain the diver's chest as close as possible to each decompression depth for the number of minutes listed. The rate of ascent between stops is not critical for stops of 50 feet or less. Commence timing each stop on arrival at the decompression depth and resume ascent when the specified time has lapsed.
For example-a dive to 82 feet for 36 minutes. To determine the proper decompression procedure: The next greater depth listed in this table is 90 feet. The next greater bottom time listed opposite 90 feet is 40. Stop 7 minutes at 10 feet in accordance with the 90/40 schedule.
For example-a dive to 100 feet for 30 minutes. It is known that the depth did not exceed 110 feet. To determine the proper decompression schedule: The exact depth of 110 feet is listed. The exact bottom time of 30 minutes is listed opposite 110 feet. Decompress according to the 110/30 schedule unless the dive was particularly cold or arduous. In that case, go to the schedule for the next deeper and longer dive, i.e., 120/40.
NOTES ON DECOMPRESSION AND REPETITIVE DIVING
PREPARED BY NAUI
Decompression Sickness
1. All scuba divers should know the cause, symptoms, treatment, and prevention of decompression sickness, plus have available the telephone number, location and method of transportation to the nearest chamber. Call ahead to the chamber to be sure it is operational.
2. Factors which increase the likelihood of decompression sickness are: Extreme water temperatures, dehydration, age, obesity, poor physical condition, fatigue, alcoholic indulgence, old injuries which cause poor circulation, and heavy work during the dive.
3. The most frequent errors related to the treatment of decompression sickness are the failure: To report symptoms or signs early, to treat doubtful cases, to treat promptly, to treat adequately, to recognize serious symptoms, and to keep the patient near the chamber after treatment.
Decompression Tables
4. There is no safety factor built into the U.S. Navy Standard Air Decompression Table.
5. A "no decompression dive" is a dive which requires no decompression stops; it still causes nitrogen to go into solution within the body. This nitrogen must be taken into account as residual nitrogen in repetitive diving. The ascent rate of 60 feet per minute is a form of decompression.
6. Bottom time starts when the diver leaves the surface and ends only when the diver starts a direct ascent back to the surface.
7. If a dive was particularly cold or arduous, or the depth/time determination may be inaccurate, or some factor increases the likelihood of decompression sickness, decompress for the next deeper and longer dive.
8. After diving, do not fly for 12 hours, or, if you must fly, use the tables for altitude diving (see Skin Diver Magazine, November 1970).
9. An exception to the tables occurs when a repetitive dive is to the same or greater depth than the previous dive and the surface interval is short enough that the residual nitrogen time from Table 11-13 is greater than the actual bottom time of the previous dive. In this case, add the actual bottom time of the previous dive to the actual bottom time of the repetitive dive and decompress for the total bottom time and deepest dive.
10. Plan repetitive dives so that each successive dive is to a lesser depth. This will aid in the elimination of nitrogen and decrease the need for decompression stops. Always keep surface intervals as long as possible.
11. Plan your dive and dive your plan; always having an alternate plan if the actual depth and/or time of the dive is greater than planned.
Reasons for Repetitive Dive Planning
12. To avoid decompression stops.
a. Be able to use tables to compute maximum time of a repetitive dive without decompression stops.
b. Be able to use tables to compute minimum surface interval needed to avoid decompression stops.
13. To stay within a particular decompression schedule or repetitive group.
14. To dive maximum depth or time on limited air.
15. To make minimum decompression stops.
16. To make the dive and take whatever decompression stops are required.

Instructions for Use
I. No-decompression limits:
This column shows at various depths greater than 30 feet the allowable diving times (in minutes) which permit surfacing directly at 60 feet a minute with no decompression stops. Longer exposure times require the use of the Standard Air Decompression Table (table 1-10).
II. Repetitive group designation table:
The tabulated exposure times (or bottom times) are in minutes. The times at the various depths in each vertical column are the maximum exposures during which a diver will remain within the group listed at the head of the column.
To find the repetitive group designation at surfacing for dives involving exposures up to and including the no-decompression limits: Enter the table on the exact or next greater depth than that to which exposed and select the listed exposure time exact or next greater than the actual exposure time. The repetitive group designation is indicated by the letter at the head of the vertical column where the selected exposure time is listed.
For example: A dive was to 32 feet for 45 minutes. Enter the table along the 35-foot-depth line since it is next greater than 32 feet. The table shows that since group D is left after 40 minutes' exposure and group E after 50 minutes, group E (at the head of the column where the 50-minute exposure is listed) is the proper selection.
Exposure times for depths less than 40 feet are listed only up to approximately 5 hours since this is considered to be beyond field requirements for this table.

Instructions for Use
Surface interval time in the table is in hours and minutes (7:59 means 7 hours and 59 minutes). The surface interval must be at least 10 minutes.
Find the repetitive group designation letter (from the previous dive schedule) on the diagonal slope. Enter the table horizontally to select the surface interval time that is exactly between the actual surface interval times shown. The repetitive group designation for the end of the surface interval is at the head of the vertical column where the selected surface interval time is listed. For example, a previous dive was to 110 feet for 30 minutes. The diver remains on the surface 1 hour and 30 minutes and wishes to find the new repetitive group designation: The repetitive group from the last column of the 110/30 schedule in the Standard Air Decompression Tables is "J." Enter the surface interval credit table along the horizontal line labeled "J." The 1-hour-and-30-minute surface interval lies between the times 1:20 and 1:47. Therefore, the diver has lost sufficient inert gas to place him in group "G" (at the head of the vertical column selected).
"Note.-Dives following surface intervals of more than 12 hours are not considered repetitive dives. Actual bottom times in the Standard Air Decompression Tables may be used in computing decompression for such dives.

Instructions for Use
The bottom times listed in this table are called "residual nitrogen times" and are the times a diver is to consider he has already spent on bottom when he starts a repetitive dive to a specific depth. They are in minutes.
Enter the table horizontally with the repetitive group designation from the Surface Interval Credit Table. The time in each vertical column is the number of minutes that would be required (at the depth listed at the head of the column) to saturate to the particular group.
For example: The final group designation from the Surface Interval Credit Table, on the basis of a previous dive and surface interval, is "H." To plan a dive to 110 feet, determine the residual nitrogen time for this depth required by the repetitive group designation: Enter this table along the horizontal line labeled "H." The table shows that one must start a dive to 110 feet as though he had already been on the bottom for 27 minutes. This information can then be applied to the Standard Air Decompression Table or No-Decompression Table in a number of ways:
(1) Assuming a diver is going to finish a job and take whatever decompression is required, he must add 27 minutes to his actual bottom time and be prepared to take decompression according to the 110-foot schedules for the sum or equivalent single dive time.
(2) Assuming one wishes to make a quick inspection dive for the minimum decompression, he will decompress according to the 110/30 schedule for a dive of 3 minutes or less (27 + 3 = 30). For a dive of over 3 minutes but less than 13, he will decompress according to the 110/40 schedule (27+13 =40).
(3) Assuming that one does not want to exceed the 110/50 schedule and the amount of decompression it requires, he will have to start ascent before 23 minutes of actual bottom time (50-27=23).
(4) Assuming that a diver has air for approximately 45 minutes bottom time and decompression stops, the possible dives can be computed: A dive of 13 minutes will require 23 minutes of decompression (110/40 schedule), for a total submerged time of 36 minutes. A dive of 13 to 23 minutes will require 34 minutes of decompression (110/50 schedule), for a total submerged time of 47 to 57 minutes. Therefore, to be safe, the diver will have to start ascent before 13 minutes or a standby air source will have to be provided.

INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE
All tabulated bottom times are in minutes: all tabulated depths are in feet
Use of table 1-11 To find the repetitive group designation at surfacing for dives involving exposures up to and including the "no decompression limits": enter table 1-11 on the exact or next greater depth than that to which exposed, and select the listed exposure time exact or next greater than the actual exposure time. The repetitive group designation is indicated by the letter at the head of the vertical column where the selected exposure time is listed.
Use of table 1-12 Continue the vertical motion along the straight line joining the repetitive group designation on table 1-11 to the repetitive group designation on table 1-12. Enter the table vertically to select the elapsed surface interval time. The new repetitive group designation for the surface interval is to the right of the horizontal column where the elapsed surface interval time is listed.
Use of table 1-13 Continue the righthanded motion to enter table 1-13 on the horizontal column to the right of the new repetitive group designation. The time in each vertical column is the number of minutes that would be required (at the depth listed at the bottom of the column) to saturate to the particular group.

Band type guards shall conform to the following specifications:
(i) The bands shall be of steel plate or other material of equal or greater strength. They shall be continuous, the ends being either riveted, bolted, or welded together in such a manner as to leave the inside free from projections.
(ii) The inside diameter of the band shall not be more than one inch larger than the outside diameter of the wheel, and shall be mounted as nearly concentric with the wheel as practicable.
(iii) The band shall be of sufficient width and its position kept so adjusted that at no time will the wheel protrude beyond the edge of the band a distance greater than that indicated in figure 12-24 and table 12-B to this rule or the wall thickness (W), whichever is smaller.
 
 
(3) Flanges.
(a) General requirements.
(i) All abrasive wheels shall be mounted between flanges which shall not be less than one-third the diameter of the wheel.
(ii) Exceptions.
(a) Mounted wheels;
(b) Portable wheels with threaded inserts or projecting studs;
(c) Abrasive discs (inserted nut, inserted washer and projecting stud type);
(d) Plate mounted wheels;
(e) Cylinders, cup, or segmental wheels that are mounted in chucks;
(f) Types 27 and 28 wheels;
(g) Certain internal wheels ;
(h) Modified types 6 and 11 wheels (terrazzo);
(i) Cutting-off wheels, types 1 and 27A (see paragraphs (D)(3)(a)(ii)(i)(i) and (D)(3)(a)(ii)(i)(ii) of this rule);
(i) Type 1 cutting-off wheels are to be mounted between properly relieved flanges which have matching bearing surfaces. Such flanges shall be at least one-fourth the wheel diameter;
(ii) Type 27A cutting-off wheels are designed to be mounted by means of flat, not relieved, flanges having matching bearing surfaces and which may be less than one-third but shall not be less than one-fourth the wheel diameter (see figure 12-19 to this rule for one such type of mounting);
(iii) There are three general types of flanges: straight relieved flanges (see figure 12-27 to this rule); straight unrelieved flanges (see figure 12-25 to this rule); and adaptor flanges (see figures 12-28 and 12-29 to this rule);
(iv) Regardless of flange type used, the wheel shall always be guarded. Blotters shall be used in accordance with paragraph (D)(3)(f) of this rule.
 

 
 
 
 
 
(b) Design and material.
(i) Flanges shall be of such design as to satisfactorily transmit the driving torque from the spindle to the grinding wheel.
(ii) Flanges shall be made of steel, cast iron, or other material of equal or greater strength and rigidity.
(iii) Flanges shall be designed with respect to rigidity so that when tightened, the radial width of bearing surface of contact on wheel is maintained (see table 12-F and figure 12-27 to this rule).
 
(c) Finish and balance.
Flanges shall be dimensionally accurate and in good balance. There shall be no rough surfaces or sharp edges.
 
(d) Uniformity of diameter.
(i) Both flanges, of any type, between which a wheel is mounted, shall be of the same diameter and have equal bearing surface. Exceptions are set forth in the remaining requirements of this rule.
(ii) Type 27 and type 28 wheels, because of their shape and usage, require specially designed adaptors. The back flange shall extend beyond the central hub or raised portion and contact the wheel to counteract the side pressure on the wheel in use. The adaptor nut which is less than the minimum one-third diameter of wheel fits in the depressed side of wheel to prevent interference in side grinding and serves to drive the wheel by its clamping force against the depressed portion of the back flange. The variance in flange diameters, the adaptor nut being less than one-third wheel diameter, and the use of side pressure in wheel operation limits the use to reinforced organic bonded wheels. Mounts which are affixed to the wheel by the manufacturer shall not be reused. Type 27 and type 28 wheels shall be used only with a safety guard located between wheel and operator during use (see figure 12-19a to this rule).
 

 
 
(iii) Modified types 6 and 11 wheels (terrazzo) with tapered K dimension.
 
(e) Recess and undercut.
(i) Straight relieved flanges made according to table 12-F to this rule and figure 12-27 to this rule shall be recessed at least one-sixteenth inch on the side next to the wheel for a distance as specified in table 12-F to this rule.
(ii) Straight flanges of the adaptor or sleeve type (see table 12-G to this rule and figures 12-28 and 12-29 to this rule) shall be undercut so that there will be no bearing on the sides of the wheel within one-eighth inch of the arbor hole.
 
(f) Blotters.
(i) Blotters (compressible washers) shall always be used between flanges and abrasive wheel surfaces to ensure uniform distribution of flange pressure (see paragraph (D)(4)(e) of this rule).
(ii) Exceptions.
(a) Mounted wheels;
(b) Abrasive discs (inserted washer, and projecting stud type);
(c) Plate mounted wheels;
(d) Cylinders, cups, or segmental wheels that are mounted in chucks;
(e) Types 27 and 28 wheels;
(f) Type 1 and type 27A cutting-off wheels;
(g) Certain internal wheels ;
(h) Diamond and cubic boron nitride wheels; and
(i) Modified types 6 and 11 wheel (terrazzo) - blotters applied flat side of wheel only.
 
 
(g) Multiple wheel mounting.
The driving flange shall be securely fastened to the spindle and the bearing surface shall run true. When more than one wheel is mounted between a single set of flanges, wheels may be cemented together or separated by specially designed spacers. Spacers shall be equal in diameter to the mounting flanges and have equal bearing surfaces.
 
(h) Dimensions.
(i) Tables 12-D and 12-F to this rule and figures 12-25 and 12-27 to this rule show minimum dimensions for straight relieved and unrelieved flanges for use with wheels with small holes that fit directly on the machine spindle. Dimensions of such flanges shall never be less than indicated and should be greater where practicable.
(ii) Tables 12-E and 12-G to this rule and figures 12-26, 12-28 and 12-29 to this rule show minimum dimensions for straight adaptor flanges for use with wheels having holes larger than the spindle. Dimensions of such adaptor flanges shall never be less than indicated and should be greater where practicable.
(iii) Table 12-H to this rule and figure 12-30 to this rule show minimum dimensions for straight flanges that are an integral part of wheel sleeves which are frequently used on precision grinding machines. Dimensions of such flanges shall never be less than indicated and should be greater where practicable.
 
(i) Repairs and maintenance.
All flanges shall be maintained in good condition. When bearing surfaces become worn, warped, sprung, or damaged they shall be trued, refaced, or replaced. When refacing or truing, care shall be exercised to make sure that proper relief and rigidity is maintained as specified in paragraphs (D)(3)(b) and (D)(3)(e) of this rule, and they shall be replaced when they do not conform to these requirements and table 12-D to this rule, figure 12-25 to this rule, table 12-E to this rule, figure 12-26 to this rule, table 12-F to this rule, figure 12-27 to this rule, and table 12-H to this rule, figure 12-30 to this rule. Failure to observe these requirements might cause excessive flange pressure around the hole of the wheel. This is especially true of wheel-sleeve or adaptor flanges.
 
 
(4) Mounting.
(a) Inspection.
Immediately before mounting, all wheels shall be closely inspected and sounded by the employer or a designated employee (ring test) to make sure they have not been damaged in transit, storage, or otherwise. The spindle speed of the machine shall be checked before mounting of the wheel to be certain that it does not exceed the maximum operating speed marked on the wheel. Wheels shall be tapped gently with a light nonmetallic implement, such as the handle of a screwdriver for light wheels, or a wooden mallet for heavier wheels. If they sound cracked (dead), they shall not be used. This is known as the "ring test."
(i) Wheels must be dry and free from sawdust when applying the ring test, otherwise the sound will be deadened. It should also be noted that organic bonded wheels do not emit the same clear metallic ring as do vitrified and silicate wheels.
(ii) "Tap" wheels about forty-five degrees each side of the vertical centerline and about one or two inches from the periphery as indicated by the spots in figure 12-20 and figure 12-21 to this rule. Then rotate the wheel forty-five degrees and repeat the test. A sound and undamaged wheel will give a clear metallic tone. If cracked, there will be a dead sound and not a clear ring.
 

 
 
 
(b) Arbor size.
Grinding wheels shall fit freely on the spindle and remain free under all grinding conditions. A controlled clearance between the wheel hole and the machine spindle (or wheel sleeves or adaptors) is essential to avoid excessive pressure from mounting and spindle expansion. To accomplish this, the machine spindle shall be made from a nominal (standard) size to plus .002 inch. A wheel which must be forced on a spindle shall not be used.
 
(c) Surface condition.
All contact surfaces of wheels, blotters and flanges shall be flat and free of foreign matter.
 
(d) Bushing.
When a bushing is used in the wheel hole it shall not exceed the width of the wheel and shall not contact the flanges.
 
(e) Blotters.
A blotter shall be used between the flange and the abrasive wheel. The blotter shall cover the entire contact area of the flange. Blotters need not be used with the following types of wheels:
(i) Mounted wheels;
(ii) Abrasive discs (inserted nut, inserted washer, and projecting stud type);
(iii) Plate mounted wheels;
(iv) Cylinders, cups, or segmented wheels that are mounted in chucks;
(v) Types 27 and 28 wheels;
(vi) Type 1 and type 27A cutting-off wheels;
(vii) Certain internal wheels ; and
(viii) Diamond and cubic boron nitride wheels.
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 
 
 
 
(E) Wire buffing wheels.
Wire buffing wheels shall be guarded unless the nature of the work is such that the material being processed acts as a shield to the periphery of the wheel, such as internal buffing.
 
(F) Polishing equipment.
(1) When dry grinding, dry polishing, or buffing is being performed, suitable hoods, or enclosures, connected to exhaust systems shall be used.
(2) Such exhaust systems shall be operated continuously whenever such operations are being done and shall be capable of preventing contaminants from entering the breathing zone.

(6) Insulated boom and platform specifications.
(a) The insulated boom and platform shall be constructed of an insulating material which will meet the test requirements specified and shall be of dielectric material which will not absorb moisture (fiberglass or equivalent). All components bridging the insulated portions of the boom structure shall have an equivalent electrical insulating value.
(b) Test electrodes.
Test electrodes shall be permanently located on the inside and outside surfaces of the insulated portion of the boom. Insulated units under sixty-nine kilovolts do not require permanent test electrodes. These electrodes shall be two to six inches from the metal portion of the lower end of the insulated upper boom. All hydraulic and air lines bridging the insulated portion of the boom shall have metallic couplings adjacent to the test electrodes. Couplings shall be insulated from the metal portion of the boom and electrically connected to the test electrodes.
(c) When insulated booms and platforms are not used in proximity to electrical conductors, the requirements of paragraphs (C)(6)(a) and (C)(6)(b) of this rule do not apply.
(D) Testing.
(1) Employees shall not be required to use aerial devices that have not been tested to withstand a static load of one and one-half the rated capacity through its entire range of motion.
(2) Employees shall not be required to use insulated boom aerial devices or basket liners near energized conductors or equipment unless such devices or liners will withstand approved electrical tests.
(3) Any equipment specified in this paragraph must be subjected to the same tests as prescribed in paragraphs (D)(1) and (D)(2) of this rule after any modification.
(E) Transfer to or from aerial basket.
Employees of the electric utility and telecommunications industries and their contractors and subcontractors shall not be required to transfer from an aerial basket to any object or structure, or from any object or structure to an aerial basket, while the aerial basket is elevated above the ground. This does not apply to operations where the aerial basket is extended over a flat surface and where the hazard of falling has been eliminated.

(b) Hose manufactured July 1987 and after.
(i) The service test pressure for hose manufactured in July 1987 and after shall meet the requirements of the of NFPA 1961, Standard for Fire Hose, standard that was in effect when it was manufactured.
(ii) Attack fire hose shall be service tested to a minimum of three-hundred psi ( 20.7 bar or two thousand-seventy kPa) or a pressure not to exceed the service test pressure marked on the hose.
(iii) Supply fire hose shall be service tested to a minimum of two hundred psi ( 13.8 bar or one thousand three hundred-eighty kPa) or a pressure not to exceed the service test pressure marked on the hose.
(iv) Forestry fire hose shall be service tested to a minimum of three hundred psi ( 20.7 bar or two thousand seventy kPa) or a pressure not to exceed the service test pressure marked on the hose.
(v) Each length of fire hose shall be indelibly marked "service test to [the service test pressure] psi (bar) per NFPA 1962."
 
(c) Hard suction hose.
Suction hose manufactured in accordance with the 2013 Edition of NFPA 1961, Standard on Fire Hose, will be marked "for vacuum use only" if it is designed for use under vacuum only. If the suction hose is designed for use under positive pressure, it will be marked "service test to (the service test pressure) and twenty-two inch Hg. vacuum per NFPA 1962."
(i) Hard suction hose shall be dry-vacuum tested annually. This test can be run in conjunction with the annual pumper suction test. The hose shall be attached to a suction source. The free-end shall be sealed with a transparent disk and connected to an accurate vacuum measuring instrument. A twenty-two-inch mercury vacuum shall be developed. While holding the vacuum for ten minutes, the lining of the hose shall be inspected through the disk. There shall be no collapsing of the lining into the waterway.
(ii) Suction hose shall not be used under positive pressure unless it has been specifically designed for such use.
 
(d) Booster hose.
Booster hose shall be tested annually in accordance with paragraph (D)(3) of this rule to one hundred ten per cent of its maximum working pressure which may be marked on the hose. If it is not marked, it shall be tested to one hundred ten per cent of the normal highest working pressure as used in the system.
 
 
(3) Service test and hose testing machine procedure. The following test procedure shall be followed:
(a) Each length of hose to be service tested shall be inspected as specified in paragraph (A)(3) of this rule. Any length of hose that fails the inspection shall be removed from the service test area and repaired as necessary or destroyed.
(b) A hose testing machine, a stationary pump, or a fire department pumper, each equipped with a hose test gate valve, shall be used for the test procedure.
(i) The hose testing machine shall be carefully examined for damaged components before commencing the service tests. This check shall be performed before each testing session. If any damage is discovered, the machine shall not be used until repairs are made.
(ii) Pressure leak integrity test shall be performed on the machine to determine if the pressurized outlet side and its components are leak free. The fire hose outlet connection(s) of the machine shall be capped or otherwise closed. Pressure shall be applied through the machine using the integral pump to a level that is ten percent higher than the highest service test pressure needed for the hose test. The pressure shall be held for three minutes with the pump turned off. If leaks are detected, the machine shall not be used until the leaking components are repaired.
 
(c) The hose test gate valve may be a fire department gate valve with a one-fourth-inch opening drilled through the gate that permits the pressure to be raised to the test pressure after the hose has been filled, the air completely removed, and the hose gate valve closed.
(d) All three and one-half-inch and larger hose shall be service tested while lying flat. A short length of smaller diameter hose with the same or higher proof pressure shall be used to connect the test valve to the hose being tested.
(e) Each length of hose to be tested simultaneously shall be of the same service test pressure .
(i) The total length of any hose line in the hose test layout to be service tested shall not exceed three hundred feet.
(ii) The hose layout shall be straight without kinks or twists.
(iii) Hose that has been repaired or recoupled shall be tested one length at a time.
 
(f) The test layout shall be connected to the hose test gate valve of the pump.
The hose test gate valve shall be used to prevent the reaction of discharging a large volume of water in the event of a hose bursting during the test. If a fire department pumper is used, the hose test gate valve shall not be attached to any discharge outlet at or adjacent to the pump operator's position. The hose test gate valve end of the hose line shall be secured with a belt tie-in or rope hose tool at a point ten to fifteen inches from the coupling. Shut-off nozzles or test caps shall be attached to the far end of the line.
 
(g) With the hose test gate valve open and the nozzle or test cap valve open, the pressure shall be gradually raised to forty-five PSI plus or minus five PSI. After the hose test layout is full of water, all air in each hose line shall be exhausted by raising the discharge end of each hose line above the highest point in the system. The nozzle or test cap valve shall be closed slowly; then the hose test gate valve shall be closed.
(h) The shutoff device or the hose directly in back of the shutoff device shall be secured to avoid possible whipping or other uncontrolled reaction in the event of a hose burst.
(i) After being filled to forty-five psi plus or minus five psi, the hose shall be checked for leakage at the coupling and tightened with a spanner wrench where necessary. Each hose shall then be marked at the end or back of each coupling to determine, after the hose has been drained, if the coupling has slipped during the test.
(j) All personnel not required to perform the remainder of the test procedure shall clear the area.
(k) The pressure shall be raised slowly at a rate not greater than fifteen psi per second until the service test pressure is attained and then maintained, by pressure boosts if necessary, for the duration of the stabilization period. The stabilization period shall be not less than one minute per one hundred feet of hose in the test layout. After the stabilization period, the hose layout shall hold the service test pressure for three minutes without further pressure boosts.
(l) While the test layout is at the service test pressure, the hose shall be inspected for leaks. If the inspecting personnel walk the test layout to inspect for leaks, they shall be at least fifteen feet to either side of the nearest hose line in the test layout. Personnel shall never stand in front of the free end of the hose or closer than fifteen feet to the hose and shall not straddle a hose in the test layout during the test.
(m) If during the test a section of hose is leaking, or if a section bursts, the service test shall be terminated, and that length of hose shall have failed the test. The test layout shall be drained, and the defective hose removed from the test layout. The service test shall be restarted beginning with paragraph (D)(3)(a) of this rule.
(n) After three minutes at the service test pressure, the pump shall be shut down, the hose test gate valve opened, the pressure allowed to equalize with the source, the pump discharge gates closed, and each nozzle or test cap valve opened to drain the test layout.
(o) The marks placed on the hose at the back of the couplings shall be observed for coupling slippage. If the coupling has slipped, the hose shall have failed the test.
(p) The hose records specified in paragraph (B) of this rule shall be updated to indicate the results of the service test for each length of hose tested.
(q) All hose failing the physical examination, bursting, leaking, or having couplings that fair because of slippage or leaking shall be tagged as required in paragraph (B)(4) of this rule, removed from service, and sent for repair. For leaking hose or for hose jackets failing the physical examination a distinguishing mark noting the location of the defects shall be placed on the hose. For defective couplings, the couplings shall be cut from the hose.
 
(4) Unlined hose.
Unlined fire hose shall not be used for fire fighting.
 
 
(E) Application.
The requirements of this rule shall apply only to fire hose, couplings, and nozzles contracted for or bought on or after the effective date of this rule, except that the requirements of paragraph (D) of this rule shall also apply to all fire hose, couplings, and nozzles owned before the effective date.

(ii) The inside diameter of the band shall not be more than one inch larger than the outside diameter of the wheel, and shall be mounted as nearly concentric with the wheel as practicable.
(iii) The band shall be of sufficient width and its position kept so adjusted that at no time will the wheel protrude beyond the edge of the band a distance greater than that indicated in figure 12-24 and table 12-B to this rule or the wall thickness (W), whichever is smaller.
 
 
(3) Flanges.
(a) General requirements.
(i) All abrasive wheels shall be mounted between flanges which shall not be less than one-third the diameter of the wheel.
(ii) Exceptions.
(a) Mounted wheels;
(b) Portable wheels with threaded inserts or projecting studs;
(c) Abrasive discs (inserted nut, inserted washer and projecting stud type);
(d) Plate mounted wheels;
(e) Cylinders, cup, or segmental wheels that are mounted in chucks;
(f) Types 27 and 28 wheels;
(g) Certain internal wheels;
(h) Modified types 6 and 11 wheels (terrazzo);
(i) Cutting-off wheels, types 1 and 27A (see paragraphs (D)(3)(a)(ii)(i)(i) and (D)(3)(a)(ii)(i)(ii) of this rule);
(i) Type 1 cutting-off wheels are to be mounted between properly relieved flanges which have matching bearing surfaces. Such flanges shall be at least one-fourth the wheel diameter;
(ii) Type 27A cutting-off wheels are designed to be mounted by means of flat, not relieved, flanges having matching bearing surfaces and which may be less than one-third but shall not be less than one-fourth the wheel diameter (see figure 12-19 to this rule for one such type of mounting);
(iii) There are three general types of flanges: straight relieved flanges (see figure 12-27 to this rule); straight unrelieved flanges (see figure 12-25 to this rule); and adaptor flanges (see figures 12-28 and 12-29 to this rule);
(iv) Regardless of flange type used, the wheel shall always be guarded. Blotters shall be used in accordance with paragraph (D)(3)(f) of this rule.
 

 
 
 
 
 
(b) Design and material.
(i) Flanges shall be of such design as to satisfactorily transmit the driving torque from the spindle to the grinding wheel.
(ii) Flanges shall be made of steel, cast iron, or other material of equal or greater strength and rigidity.
(iii) Flanges shall be designed with respect to rigidity so that when tightened, the radial width of bearing surface of contact on wheel is maintained (see table 12-F and figure 12-27 to this rule).
 
(c) Finish and balance.
Flanges shall be dimensionally accurate and in good balance. There shall be no rough surfaces or sharp edges.
 
(d) Uniformity of diameter.
(i) Both flanges, of any type, between which a wheel is mounted, shall be of the same diameter and have equal bearing surface. Exceptions are set forth in the remaining requirements of this rule.
(ii) Type 27 and type 28 wheels, because of their shape and usage, require specially designed adaptors. The back flange shall extend beyond the central hub or raised portion and contact the wheel to counteract the side pressure on the wheel in use. The adaptor nut which is less than the minimum one-third diameter of wheel fits in the depressed side of wheel to prevent interference in side grinding and serves to drive the wheel by its clamping force against the depressed portion of the back flange. The variance in flange diameters, the adaptor nut being less than one-third wheel diameter, and the use of side pressure in wheel operation limits the use to reinforced organic bonded wheels. Mounts which are affixed to the wheel by the manufacturer shall not be reused. Type 27 and type 28 wheels shall be used only with a safety guard located between wheel and operator during use (see figure 12-19a to this rule).
 

 
 
(iii) Modified types 6 and 11 wheels (terrazzo) with tapered K dimension.
 
(e) Recess and undercut.
(i) Straight relieved flanges made according to table 12-F to this rule and figure 12-27 to this rule shall be recessed at least one-sixteenth inch on the side next to the wheel for a distance as specified in table 12-F to this rule.
(ii) Straight flanges of the adaptor or sleeve type (see table 12-G to this rule and figures 12-28 and 12-29 to this rule) shall be undercut so that there will be no bearing on the sides of the wheel within one-eighth inch of the arbor hole.
 
(f) Blotters.
(i) Blotters (compressible washers) shall always be used between flanges and abrasive wheel surfaces to ensure uniform distribution of flange pressure (see paragraph (D)(4)(e) of this rule).
(ii) Exceptions.
(a) Mounted wheels;
(b) Abrasive discs (inserted washer, and projecting stud type);
(c) Plate mounted wheels;
(d) Cylinders, cups, or segmental wheels that are mounted in chucks;
(e) Types 27 and 28 wheels;
(f) Type 1 and type 27A cutting-off wheels;
(g) Certain internal wheels ;
(h) Diamond and cubic boron nitride wheels; and
(i) Modified types 6 and 11 wheel (terrazzo) - blotters applied flat side of wheel only.
 
 
(g) Multiple wheel mounting.
The driving flange shall be securely fastened to the spindle and the bearing surface shall run true. When more than one wheel is mounted between a single set of flanges, wheels may be cemented together or separated by specially designed spacers. Spacers shall be equal in diameter to the mounting flanges and have equal bearing surfaces.
 
(h) Dimensions.
(i) Tables 12-D and 12-F to this rule and figures 12-25 and 12-27 to this rule show minimum dimensions for straight relieved and unrelieved flanges for use with wheels with small holes that fit directly on the machine spindle. Dimensions of such flanges shall never be less than indicated and should be greater where practicable.
(ii) Tables 12-E and 12-G to this rule and figures 12-26, 12-28 and 12-29 to this rule show minimum dimensions for straight adaptor flanges for use with wheels having holes larger than the spindle. Dimensions of such adaptor flanges shall never be less than indicated and should be greater where practicable.
(iii) Table 12-H to this rule and figure 12-30 to this rule show minimum dimensions for straight flanges that are an integral part of wheel sleeves which are frequently used on precision grinding machines. Dimensions of such flanges shall never be less than indicated and should be greater where practicable.
 
(i) Repairs and maintenance.
All flanges shall be maintained in good condition. When bearing surfaces become worn, warped, sprung, or damaged they shall be trued, refaced, or replaced. When refacing or truing, care shall be exercised to make sure that proper relief and rigidity is maintained as specified in paragraphs (D)(3)(b) and (D)(3)(e) of this rule, and they shall be replaced when they do not conform to these requirements and table 12-D to this rule, figure 12-25 to this rule, table 12-E to this rule, figure 12-26 to this rule, table 12-F to this rule, figure 12-27 to this rule, and table 12-H to this rule, figure 12-30 to this rule. Failure to observe these requirements might cause excessive flange pressure around the hole of the wheel. This is especially true of wheel-sleeve or adaptor flanges.
 
 
(4) Mounting.
(a) Inspection.
Immediately before mounting, all wheels shall be closely inspected and sounded by the employer or a designated employee (ring test) to make sure they have not been damaged in transit, storage, or otherwise. The spindle speed of the machine shall be checked before mounting of the wheel to be certain that it does not exceed the maximum operating speed marked on the wheel. Wheels shall be tapped gently with a light nonmetallic implement, such as the handle of a screwdriver for light wheels, or a wooden mallet for heavier wheels. If they sound cracked (dead), they shall not be used. This is known as the "ring test."
(i) Wheels must be dry and free from sawdust when applying the ring test, otherwise the sound will be deadened. It should also be noted that organic bonded wheels do not emit the same clear metallic ring as do vitrified and silicate wheels.
(ii) "Tap" wheels about forty-five degrees each side of the vertical centerline and about one or two inches from the periphery as indicated by the spots in figure 12-20 and figure 12-21 to this rule. Then rotate the wheel forty-five degrees and repeat the test. A sound and undamaged wheel will give a clear metallic tone. If cracked, there will be a dead sound and not a clear ring.
 

 
 
 
(b) Arbor size.
Grinding wheels shall fit freely on the spindle and remain free under all grinding conditions. A controlled clearance between the wheel hole and the machine spindle (or wheel sleeves or adaptors) is essential to avoid excessive pressure from mounting and spindle expansion. To accomplish this, the machine spindle shall be made from a nominal (standard) size to plus .002 inch. A wheel which must be forced on a spindle shall not be used.
 
(c) Surface condition.
All contact surfaces of wheels, blotters and flanges shall be flat and free of foreign matter.
 
(d) Bushing.
When a bushing is used in the wheel hole it shall not exceed the width of the wheel and shall not contact the flanges.
 
(e) Blotters.
A blotter shall be used between the flange and the abrasive wheel. The blotter shall cover the entire contact area of the flange. Blotters need not be used with the following types of wheels:
(i) Mounted wheels;
(ii) Abrasive discs (inserted nut, inserted washer, and projecting stud type);
(iii) Plate mounted wheels;
(iv) Cylinders, cups, or segmented wheels that are mounted in chucks;
(v) Types 27 and 28 wheels;
(vi) Type 1 and type 27A cutting-off wheels;
(vii) Certain internal wheels ; and
(viii) Diamond and cubic boron nitride wheels.
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 
 
 
 
(E) Wire buffing wheels.
Wire buffing wheels shall be guarded unless the nature of the work is such that the material being processed acts as a shield to the periphery of the wheel, such as internal buffing.
 
(F) Polishing equipment.
(1) When dry grinding, dry polishing, or buffing is being performed, suitable hoods, or enclosures, connected to exhaust systems shall be used.
(2) Such exhaust systems shall be operated continuously whenever such operations are being done and shall be capable of preventing contaminants from entering the breathing zone.

(iv) Forestry fire hose shall be service tested to a minimum of three hundred psi ( 20.7 bar or two thousand seventy kPa) or a pressure not to exceed the service test pressure marked on the hose.
(v) Each length of fire hose shall be indelibly marked "service test to [the service test pressure] psi (bar) per NFPA 1962."
 
(c) Hard suction hose.
Suction hose manufactured in accordance with the 2013 Edition of NFPA 1961, Standard on Fire Hose, will be marked "for vacuum use only" if it is designed for use under vacuum only. If the suction hose is designed for use under positive pressure, it will be marked "service test to (the service test pressure) and twenty-two inch Hg. vacuum per NFPA 1962."
(i) Hard suction hose shall be dry-vacuum tested annually. This test can be run in conjunction with the annual pumper suction test. The hose shall be attached to a suction source. The free-end shall be sealed with a transparent disk and connected to an accurate vacuum measuring instrument. A twenty-two-inch mercury vacuum shall be developed. While holding the vacuum for ten minutes, the lining of the hose shall be inspected through the disk. There shall be no collapsing of the lining into the waterway.
(ii) Suction hose shall not be used under positive pressure unless it has been specifically designed for such use.
 
(d) Booster hose.
Booster hose shall be tested annually in accordance with paragraph (D)(3) of this rule to one hundred ten per cent of its maximum working pressure which may be marked on the hose. If it is not marked, it shall be tested to one hundred ten per cent of the normal highest working pressure as used in the system.
 
 
(3) Service test and hose testing machine procedure. The following test procedure shall be followed:
(a) Each length of hose to be service tested shall be inspected as specified in paragraph (A)(3) of this rule. Any length of hose that fails the inspection shall be removed from the service test area and repaired as necessary or destroyed.
(b) A hose testing machine, a stationary pump, or a fire department pumper, each equipped with a hose test gate valve, shall be used for the test procedure.
(i) The hose testing machine shall be carefully examined for damaged components before commencing the service tests. This check shall be performed before each testing session. If any damage is discovered, the machine shall not be used until repairs are made.
(ii) Pressure leak integrity test shall be performed on the machine to determine if the pressurized outlet side and its components are leak free. The fire hose outlet connection(s) of the machine shall be capped or otherwise closed. Pressure shall be applied through the machine using the integral pump to a level that is ten percent higher than the highest service test pressure needed for the hose test. The pressure shall be held for three minutes with the pump turned off. If leaks are detected, the machine shall not be used until the leaking components are repaired.
 
(c) The hose test gate valve may be a fire department gate valve with a one-fourth-inch opening drilled through the gate that permits the pressure to be raised to the test pressure after the hose has been filled, the air completely removed, and the hose gate valve closed.
(d) All three and one-half-inch and larger hose shall be service tested while lying flat. A short length of smaller diameter hose with the same or higher proof pressure shall be used to connect the test valve to the hose being tested.
(e) Each length of hose to be tested simultaneously shall be of the same service test pressure .
(i) The total length of any hose line in the hose test layout to be service tested shall not exceed three hundred feet.
(ii) The hose layout shall be straight without kinks or twists.
(iii) Hose that has been repaired or recoupled shall be tested one length at a time.
 
(f) The test layout shall be connected to the hose test gate valve of the pump.
The hose test gate valve shall be used to prevent the reaction of discharging a large volume of water in the event of a hose bursting during the test. If a fire department pumper is used, the hose test gate valve shall not be attached to any discharge outlet at or adjacent to the pump operator's position. The hose test gate valve end of the hose line shall be secured with a belt tie-in or rope hose tool at a point ten to fifteen inches from the coupling. Shut-off nozzles or test caps shall be attached to the far end of the line.
 
(g) With the hose test gate valve open and the nozzle or test cap valve open, the pressure shall be gradually raised to forty-five PSI plus or minus five PSI. After the hose test layout is full of water, all air in each hose line shall be exhausted by raising the discharge end of each hose line above the highest point in the system. The nozzle or test cap valve shall be closed slowly; then the hose test gate valve shall be closed.
(h) The shutoff device or the hose directly in back of the shutoff device shall be secured to avoid possible whipping or other uncontrolled reaction in the event of a hose burst.
(i) After being filled to forty-five psi plus or minus five psi, the hose shall be checked for leakage at the coupling and tightened with a spanner wrench where necessary. Each hose shall then be marked at the end or back of each coupling to determine, after the hose has been drained, if the coupling has slipped during the test.
(j) All personnel not required to perform the remainder of the test procedure shall clear the area.
(k) The pressure shall be raised slowly at a rate not greater than fifteen psi per second until the service test pressure is attained and then maintained, by pressure boosts if necessary, for the duration of the stabilization period. The stabilization period shall be not less than one minute per one hundred feet of hose in the test layout. After the stabilization period, the hose layout shall hold the service test pressure for three minutes without further pressure boosts.
(l) While the test layout is at the service test pressure, the hose shall be inspected for leaks. If the inspecting personnel walk the test layout to inspect for leaks, they shall be at least fifteen feet to either side of the nearest hose line in the test layout. Personnel shall never stand in front of the free end of the hose or closer than fifteen feet to the hose and shall not straddle a hose in the test layout during the test.
(m) If during the test a section of hose is leaking, or if a section bursts, the service test shall be terminated, and that length of hose shall have failed the test. The test layout shall be drained, and the defective hose removed from the test layout. The service test shall be restarted beginning with paragraph (D)(3)(a) of this rule.
(n) After three minutes at the service test pressure, the pump shall be shut down, the hose test gate valve opened, the pressure allowed to equalize with the source, the pump discharge gates closed, and each nozzle or test cap valve opened to drain the test layout.
(o) The marks placed on the hose at the back of the couplings shall be observed for coupling slippage. If the coupling has slipped, the hose shall have failed the test.
(p) The hose records specified in paragraph (B) of this rule shall be updated to indicate the results of the service test for each length of hose tested.

===================================================================



 

4125-1-01 Wage Loss Compensation 
(A) Definitions:
The following definitions shall apply to the adjudication of applications for wage loss compensation:
(1) "Adjudicator" means the administrator of the bureau of workers' compensation, a district hearing officer, a staff hearing officer, or the industrial commission. However, in the case of a wage loss application filed with a self-insuring employer, the self-insuring employer shall make the initial determination as provided in paragraph (H) of this rule.
(2) "Comparably paying work" means suitable employment in which the injured worker's weekly rate of pay is equal to or greater than the average weekly wage of the injured worker.
(3) "Employer of record" means the employer with whom the injured worker was employed at the time of the injury or on the date of disability in an occupational disease claim, or to the entity that is determined by the bureau of workers' compensation, or by industrial commission order, to succeed to the rights and responsibilities of the employer for workers' compensation claim purposes.
(4) "Employment" means work performed or to be performed pursuant to a contract of hire between an employee and an employer as those terms are defined in divisions (A) and (B) of section 4123.01 of the Revised Code. "Employment" also includes work performed or to be performed as self-employment.
(5) "Former position of employment" means the employment engaged in by the injured worker, including job duties, hours and rate of pay, at the time of the industrial injury or on the date of disability in an occupational disease claim allowed under Chapter 4123. of the Revised Code.
(6) "Injured worker," for purposes of wage loss compensation, means an employee as defined in division (A) of section 4121.01 and division (A)(1) of section 4123.01 of the Revised Code, who asserts a right, demand, or claim for benefits pursuant to division (B) of section 4123.56 of the Revised Code.
(7) "Injured worker's weekly wage loss" means his or her working wage loss or non-working wage loss during a calendar week or the injured worker's work week.
(8) "Non-working wage loss" means the dollar amount of the diminishment in wages sustained by an injured worker who has not returned to work because he or she has been unable to find suitable employment (as described in paragraph (C) of this rule.) However, the extent of the diminishment must be the direct result of physical and/or psychiatric restrictions caused by the impairment that is causally related to an industrial injury or occupational disease in a claim allowed under Chapter 4123. of the Revised Code.
(9) "Present earnings" means the injured worker's actual weekly earnings which are generated by gainful employment except as provided in paragraph (A)(9)(b) of this rule. It is a rebuttable presumption that earnings from paid leave provided by the employer will be included in present earnings.
(a) Earnings generated from commission sales, bonuses, gratuities, and all other forms of compensation for personal services customarily received by an injured worker in the course of his or her employment and accounted for by the injured worker to his or her employer will be included in present earnings for the purposes of computing the wage loss award. In instances where sales commission, bonuses, gratuities, or other compensation are not paid on a weekly or biweekly basis, their receipt will be apportioned over the number of weeks it is determined were required to initiate and consummate the sale or earn the bonus, gratuity, or other compensation.
(b) In the case of an injured worker engaged in self-employment, "present earnings" means gross income minus business-related expenses. For purposes of calculating present earnings, there shall be a rebuttable presumption that an injured worker engaged in self-employment has a gross income of at least fifty percent of the statewide average weekly wage or such other compensation that the bureau of workers' compensation shall impute to self-employed persons for purposes of determining premium payments. Income derived from self-employment shall be reported on at least a quarterly basis.
(10) "Restriction" means any physical and/or psychiatric limitation directly resulting from the allowed conditions in the claim.
(11) "Statewide average weekly wage" has the same meaning as set forth in division (C) of section 4123.62 of the Revised Code.
(12) "Suitable employment" means work which is within the injured worker's restrictions, and which may be performed by the injured worker subject to all physical, psychiatric, mental, and vocational limitations to which the injured worker was subject on the date of the injury, or on the date of disability in occupational disease claims.
(13) "Voluntary retirement" means voluntary termination of employment by an injured worker such that the injured worker is completely removed from the active work force based on factors that are not causally related to the allowed conditions in the claim.
(14) "Wages" means the amount upon which the injured worker's average weekly wage is calculated pursuant to section 4123.61 of the Revised Code.
(15) "Working wage loss" means the dollar amount of the diminishment in wages sustained by an injured worker who has returned to employment which is not his or her former position of employment. However, the extent of the diminishment must be the direct result of physical and/or psychiatric restriction(s) caused by the impairment that is causally related to an industrial injury or occupational disease in a claim allowed under Chapter 4123. of the Revised Code.
(B) Applications for wage loss compensation
Applications for wage loss compensation shall be filed on forms provided by the bureau of workers' compensation or equivalent forms. In cases involving self-insuring employers, a copy of the application shall be filed with the self-insuring employer. No payment of compensation shall be approved by the administrator, or by a self-insuring employer in a self-insured claim, unless the request is filed on the appropriate form or equivalent form that provides the required information as described in paragraph (B)(1) through (B)(4) of this rule. Upon the earlier of a determination not to pay wage loss compensation by the administrator, or by the self-insuring employer in a self-insured employer claim, or upon expiration of thirty days of the filing of the application for wage loss compensation, in the absence of payment of wage loss compensation, the application for wage loss compensation will be referred to the industrial commission.

(a) Identification of the restrictions of the injured worker;
(b) An opinion on whether the restrictions are permanent or temporary;
(c) When the restrictions are temporary, an opinion as to the expected duration of the restrictions. Temporary restrictions cannot be certified for a period to exceed ninety days without a new examination of the injured worker

(e) The date of the last medical examination;
(f) The date of the report;
(g) The name of the physician who authored the report; and
(h) The physician's signature.
(3) Supplemental medical reports regarding the ongoing status of the medical restrictions causally related to the allowed conditions in the claim must be submitted to the bureau of workers' compensation or the self-insuring employer in self-insured claims once during every ninety day period after the filing of the initial application, if the restrictions are temporary. If the restrictions are permanent, the bureau of workers' compensation or the self-insuring employer may request a supplemental medical report once during every one hundred eighty day period subsequent to the filing of the initial application. If such a request is made, both the medical examination shall be completed and the medical report resulting from the supplemental medical examination shall be submitted to the bureau of workers' compensation, or to the self-insuring employer in self-insured claims, within ninety days of the date of the request for the supplemental medical report. The supplemental medical reports shall comply with paragraph (B)(2)(a), (b), (c), (e), (f), (g), and (h) of this rule.
Paragraph (B)(3) of this rule shall not prohibit the employer's authority to require the injured worker to be examined by a physician of the employer's choice pursuant to Section 4123.651 of the Revised Code and 4121-3-09 of the Administrative Code.

(2) The completed job search statements shall be submitted with the wage loss application and/or any subsequent request for non-working wage loss compensation;
(3) An injured worker who receives non-working wage loss compensation for periods after the filing of the application for wage loss compensation shall submit the job search statements completed pursuant to paragraphs (C)(1), (C)(4) and (C)(5) of this rule, at a minimum, every four weeks to the bureau of worker's compensation or the self-insuring employer in self-insured claims during the period when non-working wage loss compensation is requested;
(4) Job search statements shall include the name and address of each employer contacted, the employer's telephone number, the position sought, a reasonable identification by name or position of the person contacted, the date and method of contact, for on-line job searches, a copy of the on-line posting and verification of the application submission, the result of the contact, and any other information requested by the bureau of workers' compensation job search statement; and
(5) Job search statements shall be submitted on forms provided by the bureau of workers' compensation or equivalent forms.
(D) Working Wage Loss Compensation
Except as otherwise provided in paragraphs (D)(4) and (D)(5) of this rule, an injured worker applying for or receiving working wage loss compensation shall supplement his or her wage loss application with a job search statement describing the injured worker's search for comparably paying work unless excused by the bureau of workers' compensation, the industrial commission, or the self-insuring employer in self-insured employer claims.
(1) Unless a job search has been excused by the bureau of workers' compensation, the industrial commission, or the self-insuring employer in self-insured employer claims, the job search statements shall comply with the following requirements:
(a) Job search statements shall be submitted for every week where working wage loss compensation is sought;
(b) The completed job search statements shall be submitted with any subsequent request for working wage loss compensation;
(c) An injured worker who receives working wage loss compensation for periods after the filing of the application for wage loss compensation shall submit the job search statements completed pursuant to paragraph (D)(1) of this rule, at a minimum, every four weeks to the bureau of workers' compensation or the self-insuring employer in self-insured employer claims during the period when working wage loss compensation is requested;
(d) Job search statements shall include the name and address of each employer contacted, the employer's telephone number, the position sought, a reasonable identification by name or position of the person contacted, the date and method of contact, for on-line job searches, a copy of the on-line posting and verification of the application submission, the result of the contact, and any other information required by the bureau of workers' compensation job search statement;
(2) Job search statements shall be submitted on forms provided by the bureau of workers' compensation or equivalent forms.
(3) Failure to perform a job search as required by paragraph (D) of this rule will be construed as a voluntary limitation of income in accordance with paragraph (G)(2) of this rule.
(4) When an injured worker qualifies for compensation for temporary total disability pursuant to division (A) of section 4123.56 of the Revised Code, working wage loss compensation may be payable, but no job search is required, when the injured worker returns to alternative employment with the same employer, or another employer at the direction of the employer of record, as provided in division (A) of section 4123.56 of the Revised Code and rule 4121-3-32 of the Administrative Code.
(5) Working wage loss compensation may be payable, but no job search is required, when the injured worker must miss work in order to obtain treatment for the allowed conditions that cannot be obtained outside of work hours. Under paragraph (D)(5) of this rule, an injured worker must file an application for wage loss compensation in addition to providing documentation that:
(a) the treatment was medically necessary for the injured worker to perform his or her job;
(b) the injured worker could not continue to work full time without the treatment; and
(c) the treatment was available only during the injured worker's hours of employment.
(E) Factors to consider in the adjudication of an application for wage loss compensation
The injured worker is responsible for and bears the burden of producing evidence regarding his or her entitlement to wage loss compensation. Unless the injured worker meets this burden, wage loss compensation shall be denied. A party who asserts, as a defense to the payment of wage loss compensation, that the injured worker has failed to meet his burden of producing evidence regarding his or her entitlement to wage loss compensation is not required to produce evidence to support that assertion. However, any party asserting a defense to the payment of wage loss compensation, for a reason other than the injured worker's failure to produce evidence, through motion, appeal, or otherwise is solely responsible for and bears the burden of producing evidence to support those defenses. If there is insufficient evidence to support a defense to the payment of wage loss compensation, that defense shall not be used as a grounds to deny such compensation. In no case shall this rule be construed as placing on the industrial commission any burden to produce evidence.
In considering an injured worker's eligibility for wage loss compensation the adjudicator shall give consideration to, and base the determinations on, evidence in the file, or presented at hearing, relating to:
(1) The injured worker's search for suitable employment when required under the provisions of this rule.
(a) As a prerequisite to receiving non-working wage loss compensation, and working wage loss compensation unless excused under paragraph (D) of this rule, for any period during which such compensation is requested, the injured worker shall demonstrate that he or she has:
(i) Complied with paragraph (B)(2) of this rule and, if applicable, with paragraph (B)(3) of this rule;
(ii) Sought suitable employment with the employer of record at the onset of the first period for which wage loss compensation is requested unless the injured worker establishes that it would be futile to seek suitable employment with the employer of record. (e.g. The injured worker was discharged or the employer of record is out of business.); and
(iii) In the case of non-working wage loss, the injured worker must register with the Ohio Department of Job and Family Services or, if the injured worker is an out-of-state resident, must register with the equivalent of the Ohio Department of Job and Family Services in the state of residence and begin or continue a job search if no suitable employment is available with the employer of record. Proof of registration with the applicable agency is required for both in-state and out-of-state residents to demonstrate compliance with this rule.
(b) An injured worker may first search for suitable employment which is within his or her skills, prior employment history, and educational background. If within sixty days from the commencement of the injured worker's job search, he or she is unable to find such employment, the injured worker shall expand his or her job search to include entry level and/or unskilled employment opportunities.
(c) A good faith effort to search for suitable employment that is comparably paying work is required of those seeking non-working wage loss compensation pursuant to paragraph (C) of this rule and of those seeking working-wage loss compensation pursuant to paragraph (D)of this rule, who have not returned to suitable employment that is comparably paying work, except for those injured workers who are receiving public relief and are defined as work relief employees in Chapter 4127. of the Revised Code. A good faith effort necessitates the injured worker's consistent, sincere, and best attempts to obtain suitable employment that will eliminate the wage loss. In evaluating whether the injured worker has made a good faith effort, attention will be given to the evidence regarding all relevant factors including, but not limited to:
(i) The injured worker's skills, prior employment history, and educational background. These factors may be considered a positive or negative asset to securing suitable employment;
(ii) The number, quality (e.g., in-person, internet / e-mail, telephone, U.S. mail, with resume), and regularity of contacts made by the injured worker with prospective employers, public and private employment services;
(iii) Except as provided in paragraph (E)(1)(c)(v) of this rule, for an injured worker seeking any amount of non-working wage loss compensation, the amount of time devoted to making prospective employer contacts during the period for which non-working wage loss compensation is sought as compared with the time spent working at the former position of employment or number of hours able to work due to the restrictions; while the adjudicator shall consider this comparison in reaching a determination of whether there was a good faith job search, the fact that an injured worker did not search for work for as many hours as were worked in the former position of employment shall not necessarily be dispositive;
(iv) Except as provided in paragraph (E)(1)(c)(v) of this rule, for an injured worker seeking any amount of working wage loss compensation, the amount of time devoted to making prospective employer contacts during the period for which working wage loss compensation is sought as well as the number of hours spent working; and any non-claim related limitations on the injured worker's opportunity to make prospective employer contacts because of his or her working; while the adjudicator shall consider this comparison in reaching a determination of whether there was a good faith job search, the fact that the sum of the hours the injured worker spent searching for work and working is not as many hours as were worked in the former position of employment shall not necessarily be dispositive;
(v) Where the injured worker, in the former position of employment, worked a variable number of hours per week, the adjudicator shall determine, with respect to the former position of employment, for the period of fifty-two calendar weeks preceding the injury, or in occupational disease cases, the date of disability, the minimum, maximum, and average number of hours per week the injured worker worked. If the injured worker worked less than fifty-two calendar weeks in the former position of employment, the determination shall be based on the number of weeks the injured worker actually worked. The adjudicator shall consider these determinations in relation to:
(a) The amount of time devoted to making prospective employer contacts during the period for which working wage loss is sought as well as the number of hours spent working, for an injured worker seeking any amount of working wage loss; and
(b)The amount of time devoted to making prospective employer contacts during the period for which non-working wage loss is sought as compared with the time spent working at the former position of employment, for an injured worker seeking non-working wage loss; while the adjudicator shall consider the determinations arrived at pursuant to paragraph (E)(1)(c)(v) of this rule in reaching a conclusion as to whether there was a good faith job search, the number of hours per week, in and of itself, shall not necessarily be dispositive.
(vi) Any refusal without good cause by the injured worker to accept assistance from the bureau of workers' compensation in finding employment;
(vii) Any refusal by the injured worker to accept the assistance, where such assistance is rendered free of charge to the injured worker, of any public or private entity or the assistance of the employer of record in finding employment;
(viii) Labor market conditions including, but not limited to, the numbers and types of employers located in the geographical area surrounding the injured worker's place of residence;
(ix) The injured worker's restrictions;
(x) Any recent activity on the part of the injured worker to change his or her place of residence and the impact such a change, if made, would have on the reasonable probability of success in the search for employment;
(xi) The injured worker's economic status as it impacts on his or her ability to search for employment including, but not limited to, such things as access to public and private transportation and telephone service and other means of communications;
(xii) The self-employed injured worker's documentation of efforts undertaken on a weekly basis to produce self-employment income;
(xiii) Any part-time employment engaged in by the injured worker and whether that employment constitutes a voluntary limitation on the injured worker's present earnings;
(xiv) Whether the injured worker restricts his or her search to employment that would require him or her to work fewer hours per week than he or she worked in the former position of employment. However, the injured worker shall not be required to seek employment which would require him or her to work a greater number of hours per week than he or she worked in the former position of employment; and
(xv) Whether, as a result of the restrictions arising from the allowed conditions in the claim, the injured worker is enrolled in a rehabilitation program with the opportunities for ohioans with disabilities agency whereby the injured worker attends an educational institution approved by the opportunities for ohioans with disabilities agency.
(2) The injured worker's failure to accept a good faith offer of suitable employment.
(a) Offers of employment by the employer of record will not be given consideration by the adjudicator unless they are made in writing and contain a reasonable description of the job duties, hours, and rate of pay.
(b) The adjudicator shall consider employment descriptions of any jobs offered to the injured worker by employers other than the employer of record.
(c) Although the injured worker's refusal to accept a good faith offer of suitable employment may be considered by the adjudicator as a reason for denying, reducing, or eliminating wage loss compensation, the injured worker may not be required, as a precondition to the receipt of wage loss compensation, to accept a job offer which would require the injured worker to work a greater number of hours per week than the former position of employment except as provided in paragraph (E)(2)(d) of this rule. The adjudicator may consider an employer's requirement that the injured worker work different shifts or relocate as factors in determining whether the injured worker failed to accept a good faith offer of suitable employment.
(d) Where the injured worker, in the former position of employment, worked a variable number of hours per week and the injured worker is offered a job which would require the injured worker to work a variable number of hours per week, the offer of variable hour employment shall not be considered an offer of unsuitable employment solely because the minimum or maximum number of hours per week to be worked by the injured worker in the position offered is insubstantially greater or less than the minimum or maximum number of hours per week which the injured worker worked in the former position of employment. In determining whether, pursuant to this paragraph, an offer of employment is suitable, the adjudicator shall:
(i) Determine, for the period of fifty-two calendar weeks preceding the date of the industrial injury or, in occupational disease cases, the date of disability, the maximum, minimum, and average number of hours per week which the injured worker worked in the former position of employment. If the injured worker worked less than fifty-two calendar weeks in the former position of employment, the determination shall be based on the number of weeks the injured worker actually worked; and
(ii) Compare the maximum and minimum number of hours per week which the injured worker could be required to work in the position of employment offered to the injured worker to the determinations made in paragraph (E)(2)(d)(i) of this rule to assist in determining whether the offer is one of suitable employment.
(3) Other actions of the injured worker which result in a wage loss not causally related to the allowed conditions in the claim, including, but not limited to, the voluntary retirement of the injured worker, provided that where an injured worker has secured employment which will likely extend beyond the short term and which will likely become comparably paying work and/or will likely provide other employment-related benefits, the injured worker's lack of a search for comparably paying work may not bar his or her receipt of wage loss compensation but is a factor that may be considered in a broader based analysis as to whether the injured worker has voluntarily limited his or her income.
(F) Orders issued by the Industrial Commission and its Hearing Officers
The industrial commission and its hearing officers in issuing orders granting or denying wage loss compensation shall comply with the requirements of division (B) of section 4121.36 of the Revised Code. To comply with division (B) of said section, the commission and/or hearing officer shall recite in those orders that they have considered and weighed the evidence, as required by paragraph (E) of this rule.
(1) In the event of a denial of compensation for a week or period of weeks for which an application has been made, the commission or hearing officer shall recite in the order that the injured worker has not met his or her burden of proving compliance with this rule for that week or period of weeks and shall state the evidence relied upon to support the denial of wage loss for that week or period of weeks.
(2) If the commission or hearing officer grants any amount of wage loss compensation for a week or period of weeks for which an application has been made, the commission or hearing officer must find and recite in the order that:
(a) The injured worker's present earnings are less than the injured worker's wages;
(b) The difference between the injured worker's wages and present earnings is the result of medical restrictions that are causally related to an industrial injury or an occupational disease allowed in a claim which was filed under Chapter 4123. of the Revised Code and in which wage loss is requested;
(c) The injured worker has made a good faith effort to search for suitable employment which is comparably paying work, when required by paragraphs (C) or (D) of this rule, but has not returned to suitable employment which is comparably paying work; and
(d) The injured worker has otherwise complied with the requirements of this rule.
(G) Computation of wage loss
(1) Unless otherwise provided in paragraphs (G)(2) and (I)(2) of this rule, diminishment of wages shall be calculated based on the:
(a) Injured worker's average weekly wage at the time of the injury or at the time of the disability due to occupational disease in accordance with the provisions of section 4123.61 of the Revised Code; and
(b) The injured worker's present earnings as defined in paragraph (A)(9) of this rule.
(2) Voluntary Limitations of Income
(a) The wage loss compensation to be paid an injured worker who voluntarily fails to accept a good faith offer of suitable employment shall be calculated as sixty-six and two-thirds percent of the difference between the injured worker's average weekly wage in the former position of employment and the weekly wage the injured worker would have earned in the employment he or she refused to accept.
(b) ) If the adjudicator finds that the injured worker has returned to employment but has voluntarily limited the number of hours which he or she is working, or has accepted a job which does not constitute comparably paying work, and that the injured worker is nonetheless entitled to wage loss compensation, the adjudicator, for each week of wage loss compensation requested by the injured worker, shall determine: the number of hours worked by the injured worker in the employment position to which he or she has returned, and the hourly wage earned by the injured worker in the employment position to which he or she has returned. In such a case, the adjudicator shall order wage loss compensation to be paid at a rate of sixty-six and two-thirds percent of the difference between: the injured worker's average weekly wage in the claim and the weekly wage the injured worker would have earned had the injured worker not voluntarily limited his or her hours.
(c) Where the adjudicator finds that the injured worker has returned to employment and has voluntarily limited the number of hours which he is working, and that the injured worker is nonetheless entitled to wage loss compensation, but that paragraphs (G)(2)(a) and (G)(2)(b) of this rule is not directly applicable, the adjudicator shall have the discretion to establish the manner to be utilized in the calculation of wage loss compensation that is not unreasonable, unconscionable or arbitrary.
(3) If an injured worker applies for wage loss compensation for a period during which he received amounts from a wage replacement program fully funded by the employer, such amounts shall be considered as present earnings for purposes of wage loss calculation.
(4) An injured worker's wage loss compensation shall not be reduced by any amounts the injured worker receives from unemployment compensation, social security disability benefits, or public or private retirement plans. The wage loss compensation of an injured worker who is receiving public relief shall not be reduced by any monies received by the injured worker from work relief.
(5) If any wage loss compensation has been paid for the same period or periods for which temporary non-occupational accident and sickness insurance is or has been paid pursuant to an insurance policy or program to which the employer has made the entire contribution or payment for providing insurance or under a non-occupational accident and sickness program fully funded by the employer, wage loss compensation paid for the period or periods shall be paid only to the extent by which the payment or payments exceeds the amount of the non-occupational insurance or program paid or payable. Offset of the compensation shall be made only upon the prior order of the bureau or industrial commission or agreement of the claimant
(H) Where the employer of record is a self-insuring employer it shall:
(1) Adjudicate the initial application for wage loss compensation and inform the injured worker of its decision no later than thirty days after a request for wage loss compensation is received;
(2) Adjudicate all issues which arise with respect to the ongoing entitlement to wage loss compensation and inform the injured worker of its decision no later than thirty days after the issue arises; and
(3) Ensure that a copy of any decision described in paragraphs (H)(1) and (H)(2) of this rule is filed with the bureau of workers' compensation or the industrial commission for placement in the claim file.
(I) Prospective application
(1) This rule shall apply to the adjudication of all applications for wage loss compensation filed on or after the effective date of this rule.
(2) Notwithstanding paragraph (I)(1) of this rule, if an injured worker files an application for wage loss compensation in a claim in which the injury occurred or the date of disability arose prior to May 15, 1997, the wage loss compensation paid shall be calculated based on the greater of the full weekly wage or the average weekly wage.

===================================================================



 

0800-2-12-.01 Purpose and Scope
(1) Purpose: The purpose of these rules is to deter the use of drugs and alcohol in the workplace.
(a) Employees who abuse drugs shall face the risk of unemployment and the forfeiture of workers' compensation benefits.
(b) These rules shall apply to those employers who voluntarily choose to avail themselves of the remedies provided for in the Workers' Compensation Law regarding drug/alcohol testing in the workplace.
(c) Employers who adopt a drug-free workplace program as prescribed herein shall qualify for reduced workers' compensation insurance premiums.
(d) If an employer does implement a drug-free workplace program as prescribed herein and a worker injured in the course and scope of employment who is tested pursuant to these rules has a positive confirmation of a drug at a level prescribed herein, a rebuttable presumption is created that the injury was occasioned primarily by the presence of the drug. Such employee may be disciplined, up to and including termination, and forfeits his or her eligibility for workers' compensation medical and indemnity benefits.
(2) Scope: The provisions of this chapter apply to all employers in the State of Tennessee subject to provisions of the Workers' Compensation Act who qualify for the drug-free workplace program. The application of the provisions of these rules are subject to the provisions of any applicable collective bargaining agreement.
Authority: T.C.A. Â§50-6-110(c), 50-9-101 and 50-6-418. Administrative History: Original rule filed January 26, 1998; effective April 11, 1998.




===================================================================
--->tennessee--->Tennessee Rules--->0800-2-12 Drug Free Workplace--->0800-2-12-.02 Policies
===================================================================



 

0800-2-12-.02 Policies
(1) Nothing in these rules shall be construed to prohibit an employer from conducting medical screening or other tests required, permitted or not disallowed by any statute, rule or regulation for the purpose of monitoring exposure of employees to toxic or other unhealthy substances in the workplace or in the performance of job responsibilities. Such screening or tests shall be limited to the specific substances expressly identified in the applicable statute, rule or regulation, unless prior written consent of the employee is obtained for other tests.
(2) Nothing in these rules shall be construed to require an employer to test or create a legal obligation upon an employer to request an employee or job applicant to undergo drug or alcohol testing.
(3) Nothing in these rules shall be construed to prohibit an employer from affording an employee greater protection than provided herein. A covered employer is not barred from conducting more extensive testing provided the employee/job applicant's constitutional rights are not infringed.
(4) Nothing in these rules shall be construed as authorizing any employer to test any employee or applicant for alcohol or drugs in any manner inconsistent with federal constitutional or statutory requirements, including those imposed by the Americans with Disabilities Act and the National Labor Relations Act.
(5) Employers who implement a drug-free workplace program pursuant to these rules will begin to accrue the premium discount on a pro rata basis as of the date of certification (the date of approval by the Tennessee Department of Labor, Division of Workers' Compensation). The covered employer's workers' compensation insurance company or self-insured pool program administrator will be notified by the Tennessee Department of Labor when an employer's drug-free workplace program has been certified. The covered employer's workers' compensation insurance company or self-insured pool program administrator must apply to such policy the premium credit granted under this program directly upon receipt of notification from the Tennessee Department of Labor or make payment for such credit effective after the annual final premium audit has been completed. In order to continue to receive the premium discount, an employer must renew annually the application for the Tennessee Drug-Free Workplace Premium Credit Program.
(6) Future Revisions.

===================================================================
--->tennessee--->Tennessee Rules--->0800-2-12 Drug Free Workplace--->0800-2-12-.05 Types of Testing
===================================================================



 

0800-2-12-.05 Types of Testing
It is a requirement that a covered employer who establishes a drug-free workplace program conduct the following types of drug tests to the extent permitted by law:
(1) Job applicant drug or alcohol testing. A covered employer must, after a conditional offer of employment, require job applicants to submit to a drug test and may use a refusal to submit to a drug test or a positive confirmed drug test as a basis for refusing to hire a job applicant.
An employer may, but is not required to, test job applicants for alcohol after a conditional offer of employment. Limited testing of applicants, only if it is based on a reasonable classification basis, is permissible in accordance with the following:
(a) A temporary, leased, seasonal or former worker who has tested negative for substance abuse within the preceding twelve (12) months from the date employment is to begin will not be required to undergo job applicant testing by the covered employer. Any such worker who has not been tested or has not tested negative must submit to job applicant testing according to Rules 0800-02-12-.07, .08 and .10.
(2) Reasonable suspicion. A covered employer must require an employee to submit to reasonable suspicion drug or alcohol testing.
(a) Employers shall, within seven days after testing based on reasonable suspicion, detail in writing the circumstances which formed the basis of the determination that reasonable suspicion existed to warrant the testing. If drug-testing is conducted based on reasonable suspicion, the covered employer shall promptly detail in writing the circumstances which formed the basis of the determination that reasonable suspicion existed to warrant the testing. A copy of this documentation shall be given to the employee upon request and the original documentation shall be kept confidential by the covered employer pursuant to TCA Â§50-9-109 and shall be retained by the covered employer for at least one (a) year.
(3) Routine fitness-for-duty drug or alcohol testing.
(a) A covered employer must require an employee to submit to a drug or alcohol test if the test is conducted as part of a routinely scheduled employee fitness-for-duty medical examination where the examinations are required by law or regulation, are part of the covered employer's established policy, or one that is scheduled routinely for all members of an employment classification group.
(b) This Rule does not require a drug or alcohol test if a covered employer's current personnel policy does not include drug or alcohol testing as part of a routine fitness-forduty medical exam. If such testing is included, it must be done on a nondiscriminatory basis for all employees. Routine fitness-for-duty drug or alcohol testing of employees would not apply to programs mandated by governmental agencies, volunteer employee health screenings, employee wellness programs, or medical surveillance procedures.
(4) Follow-up drug or alcohol testing. If the employee in the course of employment enters an employee assistance program for drug or alcohol-related problems, or a drug or alcohol rehabilitation program, the covered employer must require the employee to submit to a drug or alcohol test, as appropriate, as a follow-up to such program, unless the employee voluntarily entered the program. In those cases, the covered employer has the option to not require follow-up testing. If follow-up testing is required, it must be conducted at least once a year for a two year period after successful completion of the program. Advance notice of a follow-up testing date must not be given to the employee.
(5) Post-accident testing. After an accident which results in an injury, the covered employer shall require the employee to submit to a drug or alcohol test in accordance with these rules:
(a) An employee injured at the workplace and required to be tested shall be taken to a medical facility for immediate treatment of injury. Specimens shall be obtained at the treating facility or a designated collection site under the procedures set forth under these rules and transported to an approved testing laboratory.
(b) No specimens shall be taken prior to the administration of emergency medical care. Once this condition has been satisfied, an injured employee must submit to testing.
(c) In the case of non-emergency injuries reported to the covered employer after the fact, the injured employee must submit to testing at the time the injury is entered into the covered employer's OSHA 200 Log or any authorized or required replacement for the OSHA 200 Log.

0800-2-12-.06 Types of Testing
If an employee or job applicant refuses to submit to a drug or alcohol test, the covered employer is not barred from discharging or disciplining the employee or from refusing to hire the job applicant.

--->tennessee--->Tennessee Rules--->0800-2-12 Drug Free Workplace--->0800-2-12-.13 Substance Abuse Education/Awareness
===================================================================



 

0800-2-12-.13 Substance Abuse Education/Awareness
(1) Employee Education/Awareness Required for Certification. Each year, covered employers must provide at least one-hour of an education/awareness program for all employees about substance abuse in the workplace.
The Employee Education/Awareness Program may include, but is not limited to, the following information (Employers may choose any of the following suggested topics and/or combine them in order to fulfill this requirement):
(a) General explanation about the addictive disease of substance abuse; sample topics:
1. The disease of addiction.
2. Defining use versus abuse.
3. The recovering employee in the workplace.
4. Why people abuse substances.
5. Avoiding relapse in the workplace.
6. The role of the family in addressing substance abuse and addiction.
7. The role of co-workers in addressing substance abuse and addiction.
8. The role of co-workers in maintaining a drug-free workplace.
9. Alcoholics Anonymous: History of the AA Program.
(b) The effects and dangers of the commonly abused substances in the workplace; sample topics:
1. Stress and the workplace.
2. Safety and the workplace.
3. Warning signs.
4. The most commonly abused drugs in the workplace (e.g.; marijuana, cocaine/crack, inhalants, alcohol, opiates, hallucinogens, or prescription drugs, etc.).
5. The physical and psychological effects related to the abuse of the above drugs, and others.
6. The health & medical risks of substance abuse.
7. Avoiding substance abuse through wellness, exercise, diet, etc.
(c) This program is also a good opportunity to reinforce the employer's policies and procedures regarding workplace substance abuse. Also, the employer should remind employees of their EAP and/or substance abuse treatment options.
(2) Supervisor Training Required for Certification.
(a) In addition to the employee substance abuse education/awareness program (one-hour each year), employers must provide all supervisory personnel with a minimum of twohours per year of workplace substance abuse recognition training. Training should include: recognizing the signs of substance abuse in the workplace, how to document and collaborate signs of employee substance abuse, and how to refer substance abusing employees to proper providers for treatment. The minimum two-hours of training may be completed on one specific date, or two one-hour training sessions may be held on different dates during the year. (Supervisors should receive a minimum total of three-hours of substance abuse education/awareness & recognition training per year.)
It is recommended that supervisors complete workplace substance abuse recognition training before an employer implements a drug and alcohol testing program that includes testing based on reasonable suspicion, and/or attempting to refer an employee to an EAP or other provider for substance abuse treatment.
(b) The Supervisor Training Program should include, but is not limited to, the following information. Employers may choose from these suggested topics and/or combine them in order to fulfill the supervisor training requirement:
1. Legal aspects of reasonable suspicion employee testing for drug and alcohol: Building and establishing through observation and measurement.
2. Legal aspects regarding EAP and/or substance abuse treatment referrals: Supervisor referral, voluntary/self referral, last chance agreement.
3. How to recognize signs of employee substance abuse.
4. How to refer substance abusing employees to proper treatment providers.
5. How family problems can affect an employee's performance.
6. How to interview and detect potential workplace substance abusers.
7. When and if to test. When and how to intervene and confront potential workplace substance abusers.
8. Conducting the performance review.
9. Using positive peer pressure and management to gain support for mutual goals.
(c) Because resources available to employers across the state will vary from community to community, the employee education/awareness and supervisory training component of the drug-free workplace program is meant to be flexible so that employers may be creative in conducting these programs. For example, employers may utilize speakers, workshops, videos, written material, in-house supervisors that have been educated on how to train employees and/or supervisors regarding aspects of workplace substance abuse, any combination of the above, and/or other means of educating employees about the benefits of a drug-free workplace.
1. Important: Covered employers should keep appropriate records in order to document the completion of the employee education/awareness program and supervisor training requirements.

===================================================================



 

0800-02-17-.25 IMPAIRMENT RATINGS-EVALUATIONS AND IN MEDICAL RECORDS.(1) This rule applies to treating physicians. This rule is not applicable to independent medical examinations (IME) or impairment ratings rendered as a part of an IME pursuant to Rule 0800-02-17-.09. As used in this Rule 0800-02-17-.25 only, a treating physician is thatphysician, chiropractor or medical practitioner who determines the employee has reached maximum medical improvement regarding the condition or injury for which the physician has provided treatment. A treating physician may include any of the following:(a) a physician chosen from the panel required by T.C.A. Section 50-6-204;(b) a physician referred to by the physician chosen from the panel required by T.C.A. Section 50-6-204;(c) a physician recognized and authorized by the employer to treat an injured employee for a work-related injury; or(d) a physician designated by the Division to treat an injured employee for a work-related injury.(2) A treating physician is required and responsible for determining the employee's maximum medical improvement date and providing the employee's impairment rating for the injury the physician is treating. In some circumstances, a work-related accident may lead to multiple injuries that require multiple treating physicians. In such cases, the physician that is treating a distinct injury shall determine that the employee has reached maximum medical improvement as to that injury only and is required and responsible for providing an impairment rating for that injury only. A treating physician shall not be required or responsible for providing an impairment rating for an injury that the physician is not treating. The treating physician shall only be required to provide an impairment rating when the physician believes in good faith that the employee retains a permanent impairment upon reaching maximum medical improvement. If, after completion of the rating, it is determined that the employee has an impairment rating of zero, then the provisions of Rule 0800-02-17-.25(6) shall still apply. If the treating physician does not have a good faith belief that the employee retains a permanent impairment upon reaching maximum medical improvement, then the treating physician shall not be required to provide an impairment rating and shall not charge a fee for an impairment rating.(3) All impairment ratings shall be made pursuant to T.C.A. Section 50-6-204(d)(3)(A).(4) Within twenty-one (21) calendar days of the date the treating physician determines the employee has reached maximum medical improvement, the treating physician shall submit to the employer or carrier, as applicable, a fully completed report on a form prescribed by the Administrator. The employer or carrier, as applicable, shall submit a fully completed form to the Division and the parties within thirty (30) calendar days of the date the treating physician determines the employee has reached maximum medical improvement.(5) Upon determination of the employee's impairment rating, the treating physician shall enter the employee's impairment rating into the employee's medical records. In a response to a request for medical records pursuant to T.C.A. Section 50-6-204, a provider, treating physician or hospital shall include the portion of the medical records that includes the impairment rating.(6) The treating physician is required and responsible for providing the impairment rating, fully completing the report on a form prescribed by the Administrator, and submitting the report to the employer or carrier, as applicable, as required by these Rules. Notwithstanding Rule 0800-02-17-.15, the treating physician shall receive payment of no more than $250.00 for these services to be paid by the employer or carrier. The payment shall only be made to the treating physician. The treating physician shall not require prepayment of such fee.(7) Failure to fully complete the form and submit it within the appropriate timeframes shall subject the employer, carrier or treating physician, as applicable, to a civil penalty of $100 for every March, 2014fifteen (15) calendar days past the required date until the fully completed form is received by the Division.Authority: T.C.A.

0800-2-18-.01 MEDICARE-BASIS FOR SYSTEM, APPLICABILITY, EFFECTIVE DATE AND CODING REFERENCES. 
(1) The Medical Fee Schedule of the Tennessee Division of Workers' Compensation (TDWC) is a Medicare-based system, but with multiple conversion factors. These Medical Fee Schedule Rules apply to all injured employees claiming benefits under the Tennessee Workers' Compensation Act. The Medical Fee Schedule is based upon the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) (formerly the Health Care Financing Administration's) (HCFA) Medicare Resource Based Relative Value Scale (RBRVS) system, utilizing the CMS' relative value units (RVUs) which must be adjusted for the Tennessee Geographic Practice Index (GPCI) and the Tennessee specific conversion factors adopted by the Tennessee Division of Workers' Compensation in these Rules. These Medical Fee Schedule Rules must be used in conjunction with the current American Medical Association's (AMA's) CPT Code Guide, the Health Care Financing Administration Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS), the current and effective AMA's Medicare RBRVS: The Physicians' Guide, the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) Relative Value Guide, and current effective Medicare procedures and guidelines.
(2) These Medical Fee Schedule Rules must also be used in conjunction with Medical Cost Containment Program Rules, Chapter 0800-2-17, and the In-patient Hospital Fee Schedule Rules, Chapter 0800-2-19. The definitions set out in those rules, as well as the other general provisions, including but not limited to those regarding electronic billing and prompt payment of provider's bills, are adopted by reference as if set forth fully herein.
(3) These Medical Fee Schedule Rules are effective May 1, 2006 and apply to all services provided on or after May 1, 2006. The most current versions of the American Medical Association's CPT and the Medicare RBRVS shall automatically be applicable and are adopted by these Rules by reference upon their effective dates. Fees shall be calculated using the edition of the CPT and RBRVS effective on the date of service.

--->tennessee--->Tennessee Rules--->0800-2-18 Medical Fee Schedule--->0800-2-18-.02 GENERAL INFORMATION AND INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE.
===================================================================



 

0800-02-18-.02 GENERAL INFORMATION AND INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE.(1) Format(a) These Rules address and consist of the following sections: General Guidelines, General Medicine (including Evaluation and Management), General Surgery, Neuro- and Orthopedic Surgery, Radiology, Pathology, Anesthesiology, Injections, Durable Medical Equipment, Implants and Orthotics, Pharmacy, Physical and Occupational Therapy, Ambulatory Surgical Centers and Outpatient Hospital Care, Chiropractic, Ambulance Services and Clinical Psychological Services. Providers should consult and use the section(s) containing the procedure(s) they perform, or the service(s) they render, together with the appropriate sections of the Medical Cost Containment Program Rules, and the In-patient Hospital Fee Schedule Rules, if applicable.(2) Reimbursement(a) Unless otherwise indicated herein, the current, effective Medicare procedures and guidelines are hereby adopted and incorporated as part of these Rules as if fully set out herein and effective upon adoption and implementation by the CMS. Whenever there is no specific fee or methodology for reimbursement set forth in these Rules for a service, diagnostic procedure, equipment, etc., then the maximum amount of reimbursement shall be 100% of the current effective CMS' Medicare allowable amount. The current effective Medicare guidelines and procedures shall be followed in arriving at the correct amount. For purposes of these Rules, the base Medicare amount may be adjusted upward annually based upon the annual Medicare Economic Index adjustment. Whenever there is no applicable Medicare code or method of reimbursement, the service, equipment, diagnostic procedure, etc. shall be reimbursed at the usual and customary amount as defined in the Medical Cost Containment Program Rules at 0800-2-17-.03(80).(b) Reimbursement to all providers shall be the lesser of the following:1. The provider's usual charge;2. The fee calculated according to the TDWC Fee Schedule Rules (includes 100% of Medicare if no other specific fee or methodology is set forth in these Rules);3. The MCO/PPO or any other contracted price;4. In no event shall reimbursement be in excess of these TDWC Fee Schedule Rules, unless otherwise provided in the Division's rules. Reimbursement in excess of the TDWC Medical Fee Schedule Rules may result in civil penalties, at the Administrator's discretion, of up to $10,000.00 per violation for each violation assessed severally against the provider accepting such fee and the carrier or employer paying the excessive fee, should a pattern or practice of such activity be found. It is recognized that providers must bill all payers at the same amount and simply billing an amount which exceeds the Fee Schedule Rules does not constitute a violation. It is acceptance and retention of an amount in excess of this Fee Schedule Rules for longer than ninety (90) calendar days that constitutes a violation by a provider. At the Administrator's discretion, such provider may also be reported to the appropriate certifying board or other appropriate authority, and may be subject to exclusion from participating further in providing care under the Tennessee Workers' Compensation Act (Act).5. Any provider reimbursed or carrier paying an amount which is in excess of the maximum amount allowed under these Rules shall have a period of ninety (90) calendar days from the time of receipt/payment of such excessive payment in which to refund/recover the overpayment amount. If such amount is refunded/recovered within this ninety (90) calendar day time period, the overpayment shall not be considered a violation of these Rules by the provider/carrier and shall not be the basis for a penalty against the provider receiving or carrier paying the excessive payment.6. The lesser of comparison among (1) the provider's usual charge, (2) the maximum allowable amount pursuant to these Rules, or (3) any other contracted amount, should be determined based on the entire bill or amount due for a particular service, rather than on a line-by-line basis.(3) Fee Schedule Calculations(a) The Medical Fee Schedule maximum reimbursement amount for professional services is calculated for any specific CPT code by multiplying the CMS relative value units (RVUs) by CMS' Tennessee specific Geographic Practice Cost Index (GPCI) to establish Tennessee specific RVUs, then multiplying the adjusted Tennessee total RVUs by the appropriate Medical Fee Schedule conversion factor. Whether one uses the facility or nonfacility RVUs is determined using the current, effective Medicare guidelines and is dependent upon the location at which the service is provided. Certain specialty areas listed below do not have a specific conversion factor and the maximum reimbursement amount allowed is the usual and customary amount (defined in the Medical Cost Containment Rules at 0800-2-17-.13(80)), as indicated. For areas not listed, the maximum allowable amount is 100% of the Tennessee specific Medicare allowable amount calculated in accordance with Medicare guidelines and methodology.(4) Practitioner fees shall be based on the conversion factor of 33.9764, which shall be used in conjunction with the most current Medicare RVUs. The Division may designate another baseline conversion factor at any time through the rulemaking process. The Tennessee-specific conversion factors listed below should be applied to the service category in order to calculate the appropriate amount.Service Category TN Conversion FactorAnesthesiology.$75.00 per unitOrthopaedic and Neurosurgery* ...275%General Surgery...200%Radiology...200%Pathology...200%Physical/Occupational Therapy.....130%Chiropractic...130%General Medicine(including evaluation & management)...160%Emergency Care...200%Dentistry.100%* Orthopaedic and neurosurgeons may use the modifier ON on the HCFA 1500 form when submitting surgical charges. If the modifier or another indicator is not placed on the form, then the Tennessee Department of Health's database may be consulted in order to determine the provider's specialty.(5) Forms(a) The following forms (or their official replacements) should be used for provider billing: CMS 1500 and UB 92(b) Bills for reimbursement shall be sent directly to the party responsible for reimbursement. In most instances, this is the Insurance Carrier or the Self-Insured Employer. Insurance Carriers and/or Employers shall furnish this information to the Providers.(6) Violations of Fee Schedule Rules and Medical Cost Containment Rules(a) The Administrator, Administrator's Designee, or an agency member appointed by the Administrator, shall have the authority to issue civil penalties up to and including $10,000.00 per violation for violations of the Medical Fee Schedule Rules, In-patient Hospital Fee Schedule Rules or the Medical Cost Containment Program Rules (Rules) as prescribed in the Rules. Any party notified of an alleged violation, whether or not they are assessed civil penalties hereunder, shall be entitled to a contested case hearing before the Administrator, Administrator's Designee, or an agency member appointed by the Administrator pursuant to the Uniform Administrative Procedures Act, Tenn. Code Ann. Â§ 4-5-101 et seq., if a written request is submitted to the Division by the party within fifteen (15) calendar days of issuance of notice of such violations and of any civil penalty. Failure to make a timely request will result in the violation and penalty decision becoming a final order and not subject to further review.Authority: T.C.A.

===================================================================



 

0800-02-18-.04 SURGERY GUIDELINES.
(1) Multiple Procedures: Maximum reimbursement shall be based on 100% of the appropriate Medical Fee Schedule amount for the major procedure plus 50% of the lesser or secondary procedure(s). The major procedure shall be determined to be the procedure with the highest Medicare reimbursement.(2) Services Rendered by More Than One Physician:(a) Concurrent Care: One attending physician shall be in charge of the care of the injured employee. However, if the nature of the injury requires the concurrent services of two or more specialists for treatment, then each physician shall be entitled to the listed fee for services rendered.(b) Surgical Assistant: A physician who assists at surgery may be reimbursed as a surgical assistant. To identify surgical assistant services provided by physicians, Modifier 80 or 81 shall be added to the surgical procedure code which is billed. A physician serving as a surgical assistant must submit a copy of the operative report to substantiate the services rendered. Reimbursement is limited to the lesser of the surgical assistant's usual charge or 20% of the maximum allowable Medical Fee Schedule amount. Duly licensed physician assistants may serve as surgical assistants as deemed appropriate by the physician, and if so, that assistants' reimbursement shall not exceed 100% of the physician assistant fee that would be due under Medicare guidelines, without regard for conversion factors contained in the workers' compensation Medical Fee Schedule.(c) Two Surgeons: For reporting see the most current CPT. Each surgeon must submit an operative report documenting the specific surgical procedure(s) provided. Each surgeon must submit an individual bill for the services rendered. Reimbursement must not be made to either surgeon until the carrier has received each surgeon's individual operative report and bill. Reimbursement to both surgeons shall not exceed 150% of the maximum allowable Fee Schedule amount of the first surgeon and shall be allocated between the surgeons as agreed by them.(3) When a surgical fee is chargeable, no office visit charge shall be allowed for the day on which this surgical fee is earned, except if surgery is performed on the same day as the physician's first examination. All exceptions require use of the appropriate modifiers.(4) Certain of the listed procedures in the Medical Fee Schedule are commonly carried out as an integral part of a total service and, as such, do not warrant a separate charge, commonly known as a global fee.(5) Lacerations ordinarily require no aftercare except removal of sutures. The removal is considered a routine part of an office or hospital visit and shall not be billed separately unless such sutures are removed by a provider different from the provider administering the sutures.Authority: T.C.A.

===================================================================
--->tennessee--->Tennessee Rules--->0800-2-18 Medical Fee Schedule--->0800-2-18-.05 ANESTHESIA GUIDELINES.
===================================================================



 

 0800-2-18-.05 ANESTHESIA GUIDELINES. 
(1) General Information and Instructions.
(a) The current ASA Relative Value Guide, by the American Society of Anesthesiologists will be used to determine reimbursement for anesthesia codes that do not appear in the RBRVS. These values are to be used only when the anesthesia is personally administered by an Anesthesiologist or Certified Registered Nurse Anesthetist (CRNA) who remains in constant attendance during the procedure, for the sole purpose of rendering such anesthesia service. To order the Relative Value Guide, write to the American Society of Anesthesiologists, 520 N Northwest Highway; Park Ridge, IL 60068-2573, or call (847) 825-5586.
(b) When anesthesia is administered by a CRNA not under the medical direction of an anesthesiologist, maximum reimbursement shall be 90% of the maximum allowable fee for anesthesiologists under these Medical Fee Schedule Rules. No additional payment will be made to any physician supervising the CRNA.
(c) Whenever anesthesia services are provided by an anesthesiologist or other physician and a CRNA, reimbursement shall never exceed 100% of the maximum amount an anesthesiologist or physician would have been allowed under these Medical Fee Schedule Rules had the anesthesiologist or physician alone performed these services.
(2) Anesthesia Values
(a) Each anesthesia service contains two value components which make up the charge and determine reimbursement: a Basic Value and a Time Value.
(b) Basic Value: This relates to the complexity of the service and includes the value of all usual anesthesia services except the time actually spent in anesthesia care and any modifiers. The Basic Value includes usual preoperative and postoperative visits, the anesthesia care during the procedure, the administration of fluids and/or blood products incidental to the anesthesia or surgery and interpretation of non-invasive monitoring (ECG, temperature, blood pressure, oximetry, capnography, and mass spectrometry). When multiple surgical procedures are performed during an operative session, the Basic Value for anesthesia is the Basic Value for the procedure with the highest unit value. The Basic Values in units for each anesthesia procedure code are listed in the current ASA Relative Value Guide.
(c) Time Value: Anesthesia time starts when the anesthesiologist or CRNA begins to prepare the patient for induction of anesthesia and ends when the personal attendance of the anesthesiologist or CRNA is no longer required and the patient can be safely placed under customary, postoperative supervision. Anesthesia time must be reported on the claim form as the total number of minutes of anesthesia. For example, one hour and eleven minutes equals 71 minutes of anesthesia. The Time Value is converted into units for reimbursement as follows:
1. Each 15 minutes or any fraction thereof equals one (1) time unit. For example, 71 minutes of anesthesia time would have the following time units: 71/15 = 5 Time Units.
2. No additional time units are allowed for recovery room observation monitoring after the patient can be safely placed under customary post-operative supervision.
(3) Total Anesthesia Value
(a) The total anesthesia value (TAV) for an anesthesia service is the sum of the Basic Value (units) plus the Time Value which has been converted into units. The TAV iscalculated for the purpose of determining reimbursement.
(4) Billing
(a) Anesthesia services must be reported by entering the appropriate anesthesia procedure code and descriptor into Element 24 D of the HCFA 1500 Form. The provider's usual total charge for the anesthesia service must be entered in Element 24 F on the HCFA 1500 Form. The total time in minutes must be entered in Element 24 G of the HCFA 1500 Form.
(5) Reimbursement
(a) Reimbursement for anesthesia services shall not exceed the maximum allowable medical Fee Schedule amount of $75.00 per unit.
6) Medical Direction Provided by Anesthesiologists
(a) When an anesthesiologist is not personally administering the anesthesia but is providing medical direction for the services of a nurse anesthetist who is not employed by the anesthesiologist, the anesthesiologist may bill for the medical direction. Medical direction includes the pre and post-operative evaluation of the patient. The anesthesiologist must remain within the operating suite, including the pre-anesthesia and post-anesthesia recovery areas, except in an appropriately documents extreme emergency situations. Total reimbursement for the nurse anesthetist and the anesthesiologist shall not exceed the maximum amount allowable under the Medical Fee Schedule Rules had the anesthesiologist alone performed the services.
(7) Anesthesia by Surgeon
(a) Local Anesthesia When infiltration, digital block or topical anesthesia is administered by the operating surgeon or surgeon's assistant, reimbursement for the procedure and anesthesia are included in the global reimbursement for the procedure.
(b) Regional or General Anesthesia
1. When regional or general anesthesia is provided by the operating surgeon or surgeon's assistant, the surgeon may be reimbursed for the anesthesia service in addition to the surgical procedure.
(i) To identify the anesthesia service, list the CPT surgical procedure code and add Modifier 47.
(ii) Reimbursement shall not exceed the maximum amount allowable under these Medical Fee Schedule Rules of $75.00 per unit.
(iii) The operating surgeon must not use the diagnostic or therapeutic nerve block codes to bill for administering regional anesthesia for a surgical procedure.
(8) Unlisted Service, Procedure or Unit Value. When an unlisted service or procedure is provided or without specified unit values, the values used shall be substantiated BR.

===================================================================



 

0800-02-18-.07 AMBULATORY SURGICAL CENTERS AND OUTPATIENT HOSPITAL CARE (INCLUDING EMERGENCY ROOM FACILITY CHARGES).
(1) When medically appropriate, surgical procedures may be performed on an outpatient basis to reduce unnecessary hospitalization and to shift care to a less costly setting.March, 2014 (Revised) 8MEDICAL FEE SCHEDULE CHAPTER 0800-02-18(Rule 0800-02-18-.07, continued)(a) For the purpose of the Medical Fee Schedule Rules, ambulatory surgical center means an establishment with an organized medical staff of physicians; with permanent facilities that are equipped and operated primarily for the purpose of performing surgical procedures, with continuous physicians and registered nurses on site or on call; which provides services and accommodations for patients to recover for a period not to exceed twenty-three (23) hours after surgery. An ambulatory surgical center may be a free standing facility or may be attached to a hospital facility. For purposes of workers' compensation reimbursement to ASCs, the facility must be an approved Medicare ASC.(b) The CMS has implemented the Outpatient Prospective Payment System (OPPS) under Medicare for reimbursement for hospital outpatient services at most hospitals. All services paid under the new OPPS are classified into groups called Ambulatory Payment Classifications (APC). Services in each APC are similar clinically and in terms of the resources they require. The CMS has established a payment rate for each APC. Current APC Medicare allowable payment amounts and guidelines are available online at: http://www.cms.hhs.gov/HospitalOutpatientPPS. The payment rate for each APC group is the basis for determining the maximum total payment to which an ASC or hospital will be entitled.(c) Under the Medical Fee Schedule Rules, the OPPS reimbursement system shall be used for reimbursement for all outpatient services, wherever they are performed, in a free-standing ASC or hospital setting. The most current, effective Medicare APC rates shall be used as the basis for facility fees charged for outpatient services and shall be reimbursed at a maximum of 150% of current value for such services. Depending on the services provided, ASCs and hospitals may be paid for more than one APC for an encounter. When multiple surgical procedures are performed during the same surgical session, maximum reimbursement shall be based on 100% of the appropriate Medical Fee Schedule amount for the major procedure plus 50% of the lesser or secondary procedure(s); provided, that the major procedure shall be determined to be the procedure with the highest Medicare reimbursement. Only separate and distinct surgical procedures shall be billed. Medicare guidelines shall be consulted and used in determining separate and distinct surgical procedures.(d) If a claim contains services that result in an APC payment but also contains packaged services, separate payment of the packaged services is not made since the payment is included in the APC. However, charges related to the packaged services are used in setting outlier calculations.(e) Reimbursement for all outpatient services is based on the Medicare Ambulatory Payment Classification (APC) national unadjusted base rates, which can be obtained from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. There are no adjustments for wage-price indices and these are not hospital-specific APC rate calculations. Reimbursements for Critical Access Hospitals (CAH) are not based on CAH methodology but on the national unadjusted APC base rates as described in the preceding sentence.(f) Status indicators used under Medicare should be interpreted using Medicare guidelines with the exception of status indicator C, which Medicare does not reimburse for outpatient services, but requires inpatient treatment. Under these Rules, these procedures listed with status indicator C performed on an outpatient basis shall be reimbursed, but with the maximum amount being usual & customary, which is 80% of the billed charges, as defined in the Division's Rule 0800-2-17-.03(80).(g) All other outpatient hospital care in all ASCs and all hospitals, including but not limited to observation and emergency room facility fees, shall be calculated in accordance with the most current Medicare rules and procedures applicable to such services and shall March, 2014 (Revised) 9MEDICAL FEE SCHEDULE CHAPTER 0800-02-18(Rule 0800-02-18-.07, continued)be reimbursed at a maximum rate of 150% of the current value of Medicare reimbursement for outpatient hospital care.(h) Facility services do not include (the following services may be billed and reimbursed separately from the facility fees, if allowed under current Medicare guidelines, with the exception of implantables, which at the discretion of the facility shall be billed and reimbursed separately in all cases and in all settings unless they are billed and reimbursed as part of a package or bundled charge):1. Physician services2. Laboratory Services (including pathology)3. Radiology services (professional and/or technical components may only be separately reimbursed when not included in APC)4. Diagnostic procedures not related to the surgical procedure5. Prosthetic devices6. Ambulance services7. Orthotics8. Implantables9. DME for use in the patient's home10. CRNA or Anesthesia Physician Services (supervision of CRNA is included in the facility fee)11. Take home medications12. Take home supplies(i) For cases involving implantation of medical devices, the facility shall at their discretion for each individual patient case, choose to bill and shall subsequently be reimbursed at either:1. 150% of the entire Medicare OPPS payment as described above; or2. 150% of the non-device portion of the APC within the Medicare OPPS payment and separately bill and be reimbursed for implantable medical devices as described under Rule 0800-02-18-.10.(j) The listed services and supplies in subsection (1)(h) above shall be reimbursed according to the Medical Fee Schedule Rules, or at the usual and customary amount, as defined in these Rules, for items/services not specifically addressed in the Medical Fee Schedule Rules.(k) There may be emergency cases or other occasions in which the patient was scheduled for outpatient surgery and it becomes necessary to admit the patient. All hospitals with ambulatory patients who stay longer than 23 hours past ambulatory surgery and are formally admitted to the hospital as an inpatient will be paid according to the In-patient Hospital Fee Schedule Rules, 0800-02-19. All ASCs shall be paid pursuant to this Rule 0800-02-18-.07 regardless of the patient's length of stay. March, 2014 (Revised) 10MEDICAL FEE SCHEDULE CHAPTER 0800-02-18(Rule 0800-02-18-.07, continued)(l) Pre-admission lab and x-ray may be billed separately from the Ambulatory Surgery bill when performed 24 hours or more prior to admission, and will be reimbursed the lesser of billed charges or the payment limit of the fee schedule. Pre-admission lab and radiology are not included in the facility fee.(m) Facility fees for surgical procedures not listed shall be reimbursed BR with a maximum of the usual and customary rate as defined in the Division's Rule 0800-02-17-.03(80).Authority: T.C.A.

===================================================================



 

0800-02-19-.03 SPECIAL GROUND RULES  INPATIENT HOSPITAL SERVICES.(1) This section defines the reimbursement procedures and calculations for inpatient health care services by all hospitals. Hospital reimbursement is divided into two (2) groups based on type of admission (surgical or non-surgical (medical)) and length of stay (less than eight (8) days/over seven (7) days). Rehabilitation and Psychiatric hospitals are grouped separately.(2) General Information(a) For each inpatient claim submitted, the provider shall assign a Diagnosis Related Group (DRG) code which appropriately reflects the patient's primary cause for hospitalizationto determine average length of stay and for tracking purposes. Hospitals within each peer group are subject to a maximum amount per inpatient day.(b) The maximum per diem rates to be used in calculating the reimbursement rate is as follows:1. Peer Group 1 $1,800.00 Surgical adm. for the first seven (7) days;1,500.00 per day thereafter (surgical adm.)Includes Intensive Care (ICU) & Critical Care (CCU)$1,500.00 Medical adm. for first seven (7) days;1,250.00 per day thereafter (medical adm.)2. Peer Group 2 $1,000.00 For the first seven (7) days;(Rehabilitation) 800.00 per day thereafter3. Peer Group 3 $700.00 Psychiatric Hospitals (applicable to chemical dependency as well.)(c) All trauma care at any licensed Level 1 Trauma Center only shall be reimbursed at a maximum rate of $3,000.00 per day for each day of patient stay.(d) Surgical implants shall be reimbursed separately and in addition to the per diem hospital charges.1. Reimbursement for trauma inpatient hospital services shall be limited to the lesser of the maximum allowable as calculated by the appropriate per diem rate, or the hospital's billed charges minus any non-covered charges.2. Non-covered charges are: convenience items, charges for services not related to the work injury/illness services that were not certified by the payer or their representative as medically necessary.3. Additional reimbursement may be made in addition to the per diem for implantables (i.e. rods, pins, plates and joint replacements, etc.). Maximum reimbursement for implantables for which charges are $100.00 or less per item shall be limited to eighty percent (80%) of billed charges. Maximum reimbursement for implantables for which charges are over $100.00 is limited to a maximum of the hospital's cost plus fifteen percent (15%) of the invoice amount, up to a maximum of invoice plus $1,000.00. This is applicable per item, and is not cumulative. Implantables shall be billed using the appropriate HCPCS codes, when available. Billing for implantables which have an invoice amount over $100.00 shall be accompanied by an invoice if requested by the payer.4. The following items are not included in the per diem reimbursement to the facility and may be reimbursed separately. All of these items must be listed with the applicable CPT/HCPCS.(i) Durable Medical Equipment(ii) Orthotics and Prosthetics(iii) Implantables(iv) Ambulance Services March, 2014 (Revised) 4IN-PATIENT HOSPITAL FEE SCHEDULE CHAPTER 0800-02-19(Rule 0800-02-19-.03, continued)(v) Take home medications and supplies(vi) Radiology Services(vii) Pathology Services(e) The items listed in subsection (d)(4) shall be reimbursed according to the Medical Cost Containment Program Rules (Chapter 0800-02-17) and Medical Fee Schedule Rules (Chapter 0800-02-18) payment limits. Refer to the maximum rates set forth in Rule 0800-02-18-.02(4) for practitioner fees. Items not listed in the Rules shall be reimbursed at the usual and customary rate as defined in Rule 0800-02-17-.03(80), unless otherwise indicated herein.(f) Per diem rates are all inclusive (with the exception of those items listed in subsection (d)(4) above).(g) The In-patient Hospital Fee Schedule allows for independent reimbursement on a case-by-case basis if the particular care exceeds the Stop-Loss Threshold.(3) Reimbursement Calculations(a) Explanation1. Each admission is assigned an appropriate DRG.2. The applicable Standard Per Diem Amount (SPDA) is multiplied by the length of stay (LOS) for that admission.3. The Workers' Compensation Reimbursement Amount (WCRA) is the total amount of reimbursement to be made for that particular admission.(b) Formula: LOS X SPDA = WCRA(c) Example: DRG 222: Knee Procedures W/O CCHospital Peer Group: 1-Surgical admission:Maximum rate per day: $1,800 first seven (7) days/$1,500 per day each day thereafterNumber billed days: 9Billed charges: $15,600Maximum Allowable Payment: $15,600(4) Stop-Loss Method(a) Stop-loss is an independent reimbursement factor established to ensure fair and reasonable compensation to the hospital for unusually costly services rendered during treatment to an injured worker.(b) Explanation1. To be eligible for stop loss payment, the total Allowed Charges for a hospital admission must exceed the hospital maximum payment, as determined by the hospital maximum payment rate per day, by at least $15,000. Amounts for items set forth in rule 0800-02-19-.03(d)(4.), such as implantables, radiology, pathology March, 2014 (Revised) 5IN-PATIENT HOSPITAL FEE SCHEDULE CHAPTER 0800-02-19(Rule 0800-02-19-.03, continued)services, DME, etc., shall not be included in determining the total Allowed Charges for stop-loss calculations.2. This stop-loss threshold is established to ensure compensation for unusually extensive services required during an admission.3. Once the allowed charges reach the stop-loss threshold, reimbursement for all additional charges shall be made based on a stop-loss payment factor of 80%.4. The additional charges are multiplied by the Stop-Loss Reimbursement Factor (SLRF) and added to the maximum allowable payment.(c) Formula: (Additional Charges x SLRF) + Maximum Allowable Payment = WCRA(d) Example: DRG 222: Knee Procedures W/O CCHospital Peer Group: 1  Surgical admissionMaximum rate per day: $1,800 for first 7 days; 1,500 for 2 additional daysNumber Billed Days: 9Total Billed Charges(after subtracting amounts for implants, radiology, etc.): ................................ $53,650.00Maximum allowable payment for Normal DRG stay ........................................ $15,600.00Total difference, charges over and above maximum payments ..................... $38,050.00(if this amount is $15,000 or less, then stop-loss is not applicable)Difference over and above $15,000 Stop-loss is ............................................ $23,050.00Payable under Stop-loss (80% of $23,050.00) ................................................ $18,440.00Amounts due hospital for implants, radiology, etc. ............................................ $3,525.00Maximum fee schedule amount: ........15,600.00 + 18,440.00 + 3,525.00 = $37,565.00Proper reimbursement would be the lesser of billed charges, maximum fee schedule amount, or other contracted or negotiated rate(5) Billing for In-patient Admissions(a) All bills for in-patient institutional services should be submitted on the standard UB-92 form or any revision to that form approved for use by the CMS.Authority: T.C.A.

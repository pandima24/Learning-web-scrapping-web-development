The board of appeals shall exercise its own judgment and discretion in all matters entrusted to it, and, to that extent, shall be entirely separate and distinct from and independent of the Department of Industrial Relations, but it shall have offices with the Department of Industrial Relations, and an employee of the Department of Industrial Relations shall act as its clerk. All proper expenses of the board of appeals shall be paid from the appropriations to the Department of Industrial Relations in the same manner as expenses of the department are paid. There shall be three members of the board of appeals, all of whom shall be appointed by the Governor, subject to confirmation by the Senate, for a term of office of six years or until their successors are appointed; except, that the first appointments of members of the board of appeals shall be for terms of two, four and six years respectively. One member of the board shall be a person who, on account of his or her previous employment or affiliations, shall be generally classified as a representative of employers. One member of the board shall be a person who, on account of his or her previous employment or affiliations, shall be generally classified as a representative of employees. One member of the board shall represent the interest of the public, shall not be generally classified as a representative of employers or of employees and shall be the chair of the board of appeals. Before entering upon the discharge of his or her duties, each member of the board of appeals shall take the constitutional oath of office.

Members of the board of appeals shall receive no salary but shall be paid for each day or part thereof necessarily spent in the discharge of their official duties, including travel time, an amount to be agreed upon by the Director of Industrial Relations and the Governor, the same not to exceed one hundred dollars ($100) per day. The sum total to be paid to each member of the board in any calendar year shall not exceed twenty-four thousand dollars ($24,000) plus travel allowance and expense allowance as provided in Article 2 of Chapter 7 of Title 36. The board of appeals may meet as necessary when it has been determined by the Director of Industrial Relations that the number of appeals pending before the board of appeals shall require that the board meet and hold hearings or review cases. Members of the board of appeals shall be subject to impeachment as are other state officers. Vacancies for any reason shall be filled by appointment by the Governor for the unexpired term, and any appointments made while the Senate is not in regular session shall be effective ad interim.

The board of appeals shall not hear or determine any appeal unless each of the three members thereof or their alternates are present. The Governor shall immediately, whenever it is shown to his or her satisfaction that a member of the board of appeals is disqualified for any reason or cannot attend a session of the board of appeals, appoint an alternate or alternates for the member or members so disqualified or absent.

Section 25-2-13Board of appeals - Powers and duties generally; appeals from findings as to dangerous condition, etc., of machines, etc.
(a) The functions and duties of the board of appeals shall be as follows:
(1) To hear and determine appeals under Chapter 4 of this title.
(2) To hold public hearings on proposed safety rules and regulations and amendments and repeals thereof, and to promulgate and publish such rules and regulations and amendments and repeals as provided in this chapter.
(3) To hear and determine appeals from the finding of any officers or employees of the Department of Industrial Relations that any machine, tool, equipment or structure is in a dangerous condition or is not properly guarded or is dangerously placed, when the discontinuance of the use thereof has been ordered.
(b) When such appeal is taken by a person affected by such order, no appeal shall be taken from such determination of the board of appeals, except on questions of law or on the ground that the determination is not supported by the preponderance of the evidence; and unless an appeal shall have been taken within 10 days after the determination of the case by the board of appeals and after notice of such determination shall have been mailed by registered or certified mail, postage prepaid, to the person affected by such order at the address furnished by him, or, if none shall have been furnished, at the address of his place of business, such an appeal shall be waived. Such appeals shall be taken to the Court of Civil Appeals.
(c) Any person affected by such order may, however, as an alternative to an appeal to the board of appeals, appeal to the circuit court of the county in which such machine, tool, equipment or structure is located, and the trial in such court shall be de novo, and in such appeal the Director of Industrial Relations shall be styled as plaintiff and the party appealing as defendant and the burden of proof shall rest upon the director. If any such person at the time of taking the appeal shall fail to request a jury, the trial shall be by the court without a jury. If any such person shall request an immediate hearing on such appeal and shall not request a jury trial, such appeal shall be a preferred case and shall be immediately heard and determined by any judge of the circuit court to whom application is made, at any location in the circuit. Either party shall have the right of appeal from the judgment or decree of the circuit court to the Court of Civil Appeals.
(d) Appeals from such finding of the board of appeals or of the circuit court shall be taken within 10 days from the effective date of the same by filing a notice of appeal with the clerk of the board, or clerk of the circuit court, as the case may be, which notice shall describe the finding from which the appeal is taken, and a copy thereof shall forthwith be mailed to the Director of Industrial Relations by the clerk. An appeal by the defendant from such finding shall operate to supersede the same if at the time of taking said appeal the party taking the same shall file with the notice of appeal a bond in such sum as the board of appeals or judge of the circuit court, as the case may be, may prescribe, with sufficient surety to be approved by the clerk of said board or court, as the case may be, payable to the Director of Industrial Relations with conditions that the party appealing will prosecute said appeal to effect and if he fail therein will pay all damage which any person may sustain on account of any injury which may be proximately caused by the dangerous condition of the machine, tool, equipment or structure affected by such finding. All court costs shall be taxed against the party or parties against whom judgment is rendered and against the state when rendered against the Director of Industrial Relations.

(1) COMPENSATION. The money benefits to be paid on account of injury or death, as provided in Articles 3 and 4. The recovery which an employee may receive by action at law under Article 2 of this chapter is termed "recovery of civil damages," as provided for in Sections 25-5-31 and 25-5-34. "Compensation" does not include medical and surgical treatment and attention, medicine, medical and surgical supplies, and crutches and apparatus furnished an employee on account of an injury.

(3) DEPENDENT CHILD or ORPHAN. An unmarried child under the age of 18 years or one over that age who is physically or mentally incapacitated from earning.
(4) EMPLOYER. Every person who employs another to perform a service for hire and pays wages directly to the person.

The inclusion of an employer's insurer within the term shall not provide the insurer with immunity from liability to an injured employee, or his or her dependent in the case of death to whom the insurer would otherwise be subject to liability under Section 25-5-11. Notwithstanding the provisions of this chapter, in no event shall a common carrier by motor vehicle operating pursuant to a certificate of public convenience and necessity be deemed the "employer" of a leased-operator or owner-operator of a motor vehicle or vehicles under contract to the common carrier.
(5) EMPLOYEE or WORKER. The terms are used interchangeably, have the same meaning throughout this chapter, and shall be construed to mean the same. The terms include the plural and all ages and both sexes.

Any reference in this chapter to a "worker" or "employee" shall, if the worker or employee is dead, include his or her dependent, as defined in this chapter, if the context so requires.
(6) WAGES or WEEKLY WAGES. The terms shall in all cases be construed to mean "average weekly earnings", based on those earnings subject to federal income taxation and reportable on the Federal W-2 tax form which shall include voluntary contributions made by the employee to a tax-qualified retirement program, voluntary contributions to a Section 125 cafeteria program, and fringe benefits as defined herein. Average weekly earnings shall not include fringe benefits if and only if the employer continues the benefits during the period of time for which compensation is paid. "Fringe benefits" shall mean only the employer's portion of health, life, and disability insurance premiums.
(7) ACCIDENT. The term, as used in the phrases "personal injuries due to accident" or "injuries or death caused by accident" shall be construed to mean an unexpected or unforeseen event, happening suddenly and violently, with or without human fault, and producing at the time injury to the physical structure of the body or damage to an artificial member of the body by accidental means.
(8) INJURIES BY AN ACCIDENT ARISING OUT OF AND IN THE COURSE OF THE EMPLOYMENT. Without otherwise affecting either the meaning or interpretation of the clause, the clause does not cover workers except while engaged in or about the premises where their services are being performed or where their service requires their presence as a part of service at the time of the accident and during the hours of service as workers.
(9) INJURY.

===================================================================

 
Section 25-5-8 Employers' options to secure payment of compensation. (a) Option to insure risks. An employer subject to this chapter may secure the payment of compensation under this chapter by insuring and keeping insured his or her liability in some insurance corporation, association, organization, insurance association, corporation, or association formed of employers and workers or formed by a group of employers to insure the risks under this chapter, operating by mutual assessment or other plans or otherwise. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the insurance association, organization, or corporation shall have first had its contract and plan of business approved in writing by the Commissioner of the Department of Insurance of Alabama and have been authorized by the Department of Insurance to transact the business of workers' compensation insurance in this state and under the plan. Notwithstanding any other provision of the law to the contrary, the obligations of employers under law for workers' compensation benefits for injury of employees may be insured by any combination of life, disability, accident, health, or other insurance provided that the coverages insure without limitation or exclusion the workers' compensation benefits of this state. (b) Option to operate as self-insurer. An employer subject to this chapter who elects not to insure his or her liability thereunder shall furnish satisfactory proof to the director of his or her financial ability to pay directly compensation in the amount and manner and when due as provided by this chapter. Upon receiving satisfactory proof, the director shall authorize the employer to operate as a self-insurer. The director may prescribe other reasonable rules and regulations for the purpose of protecting the injured employee or the employee's dependents and set reasonable fees to accompany self-insurance applications. (c) Evidence of compliance. An employer subject to this chapter shall file with the director, on a form prescribed by the director, annually or as often as the director in his or her discretion deems necessary, evidence of compliance with the requirements of this section. In cases where insurance is taken with a carrier duly authorized to write such insurance in this state, notice of insurance coverage filed by the carrier shall be sufficient evidence of compliance by the insured. (d) Certificate of compliance. (1) ISSUANCE, REVOCATION. Upon the employer's complying with subsection (b) of this section relating to self-insurance, the director shall issue to the employer a certificate, which shall remain in force for a period fixed by the director. Upon 60 days' notice and hearing to the employer, the director may, for financial reasons, for failure of the employer to faithfully discharge his or her obligations according to the agreements contained in his or her application for self-insurance, or for the violation of any reasonable rule or regulation prescribed by the director, revoke the self-insurance certificate, in which case the employer shall immediately insure his or her liability. Certificates of self-insurance issued prior to September 17, 1973, shall continue in force but shall become subject to revocation as provided in this subsection. At any time after the revocation, the director may grant a new certificate to the employer upon application by the employer. (2) APPEALS. An appeal may be taken from any ruling of the director under subsection (b) of this section or under this subsection to the circuit court. The presiding judge shall, within 10 days after notification of appeal, assign a member of the court to hear the case and the matter shall be set for hearing at the earliest available time. Trial shall be de novo. The taking of an appeal shall not stay the ruling or order appealed from unless good and sufficient bond approved by the judge of the court to which the appeal is taken shall be filed with the court, conditioned on complying with such order as may be legally made effective and further conditioned upon payment by the employer of all final orders for compensation that may be rendered against the employer pending the disposition of the appeal. (e) Penalties for failure to secure payment of compensation; injunctions. An employer required to secure the payment of compensation under this section who fails to secure compensation shall be guilty of a misdemeanor, and upon conviction thereof, shall be subject to a fine of not less than $100.00 nor more than $1,000.00. In addition, an employer required to secure the payment of compensation under this section who fails to secure the compensation shall be liable for two times the amount of compensation which would have otherwise been payable for injury or death to an employee. The director may apply to a court of competent jurisdiction for an injunction to restrain threatened or continued violation of any provisions relating to the requirements of insurance or self-insurance. The court may impose civil penalties against an employer in noncompliance with this amendatory act, in an amount not to exceed $100.00 per day. Subsequent compliance with this amendatory act shall not be a defense. (f) Employer insurance policies. (1) REQUIRED AND PROHIBITED PROVISIONS. Insurance policies written pursuant to this section shall contain a clause to the effect that, as between the worker and the insurer, notice to and knowledge by the employer of the occurrence of the injury shall be deemed notice and knowledge on the part of the insurer; that jurisdiction of the employer for the purpose of this chapter shall be jurisdiction of the insurer; and that the insurer will in all things be bound by and subject to the award or judgment rendered against the employer upon the risk so insured. The policies shall provide that the worker shall have an equitable lien upon any amount that shall become owing, on account of the policy, to the employer from the insurer, and in case of legal incapacity or inability of the employer to receive the amount owing and pay it over to the worker or his or her dependent, that the insurer will pay the same direct to the worker or dependent, thereby discharging all obligations under the policy to the employer and all the obligations of the employer and the insurer to the worker. Such policies, however, shall contain no obligations relieving the insurance company from payment of obligations if the employer becomes insolvent or discharged in bankruptcy or otherwise during the period the policy is in force, if the compensation remains owing. The insurer shall be one authorized by law to conduct business in the State of Alabama, and all insurance companies writing such insurance may include in their policies, in addition to the requirements now provided by law, the additional requirements, terms, and conditions provided in this section. (2) FILING OF AND APPROVAL OF PREMIUM AND RISK CLASSIFICATIONS. An insurance corporation, mutual corporation, reciprocal exchange, or association authorized to transact the business of workers' compensation insurance in this state and which insures employers against liability for compensation under this chapter shall file with the Department of Insurance its classification of risks and premiums relating thereto and any subsequent proposed classification of risks and premiums, together with the basic rates and merit-rating schedules, if a system of schedule rating or merit rating is used by the insurance corporation, exchange, or association, none of which shall take effect until the Commissioner of the Department of Insurance shall have approved the same as reasonable, adequate, and not excessive. All filings with the Department of Insurance containing aggregate industry data of classifications of risks and premiums, rates, and merit-rating schedules pertaining to workers' compensation insurance shall be public records, notwithstanding any other provisions of Alabama law. The Commissioner of the Department of Insurance shall convene a public hearing with reasonable public notice for the purpose of considering public testimony and other evidence relevant to any filing prior to approval of any bureau loss cost or rate filing related to workers' compensation insurance. Within 10 days after approval, the Commissioner of the Department of Insurance shall make or cause to be made a sufficient number of copies of same for that purpose, and shall mail at least one copy of each of the same to every insurance carrier writing workers' compensation business in the State of Alabama, at the carrier's last address or at the last address of its designated agent to receive the same. The insurance carrier shall (or if it is a member of or associated with a rating or inspection bureau, either or both of them, or a concern or aggregation of like character, it shall cause the rating and inspection bureau, either or both, or concern or aggregation of like character with which it is affiliated to do so) file with the Department of Insurance a full and complete statement of the actuarial and underwriting experience data and the like in its possession, from which and upon which the rates, schedules, and systems so filed were ascertained, calculated, and constructed, and within six months after the expiration of each succeeding six months, shall file a like statement of all actuarial and underwriting data and the like, pertaining to the rates, schedules, and system accumulated or acquired by it during the preceding six months. Upon failure to file the statement within the time specified above, the rates, schedules, and systems may be presumed by the Commissioner of the Department of Insurance, without more, to be excessive, unreasonable, inadequate to provide the necessary reserves, or discriminatory, as the case may be. The Commissioner of the Department of Insurance may withdraw his or her approval of any premium rate or schedule made by an insurance corporation, association, mutual corporation, or reciprocal exchange, if, in his or her judgment, the premium rate or schedule is excessive, unreasonable, discriminatory, or inadequate to provide the necessary reserves. The commissioner shall withdraw approval of any premium rate or schedule shown by a motor common carrier employer to be conditioned on the motor common carrier accepting the coverage of owner-operators or lease-operators as a condition to providing coverage for the motor common carrier employer's employees. Nothing contained in this chapter or in any other law of this state shall affect the right of an insurance corporation or a mutual or reciprocal insurance corporation or association to issue participating policies or contracts or to pay savings, refunds, or dividends upon the policies or contracts. (3) PAYMENT OF INSURANCE COSTS BY EMPLOYEES. No agreement by an employee to pay to an employer any portion of the cost of insuring his or her risk under this chapter shall be valid unless the agreement between the employer and employee, the plan of which is part of a contract, is approved in writing by the commissioner. But the employer and the worker may agree to carry the risks and to provide other and greater benefits, such as additional compensation; accident, sickness, or old age insurance; or benefits, and the fact that the plan involves a contribution by the worker shall not prevent its validity if the plan has been approved in writing by the commissioner. An employer who makes any charge or deduction prohibited by this section is guilty of a misdemeanor. (4) DIRECT ACTIONS AGAINST INSURERS. If the employer insures the payment of the compensation provided by this chapter and according to the full benefits thereof and with full coverage under this chapter in a corporation or association authorized to do business in Alabama and approved by the commissioner, and if the employer posts a notice or notices in a conspicuous place or in conspicuous places about his or her place of employment, stating that he or she is insured and by whom insured; and if the employer files a copy of the notice with the Department of Insurance, then, and in such case, any civil actions brought by an injured employee or the employee's dependent shall be brought directly against the insurer, and the employer, or insured, shall be released from any further liability. If the insurance company is insolvent or bankrupt, or if it cannot be reached by due diligence by process in this state, the employer shall not be released from liability under this chapter. Should any recovery be had in excess of the amount of the insurance carried, the employer shall be liable for the excess. The return of execution upon a judgment of an employee against an insurance company, unsatisfied in whole or in part, shall be conclusive evidence of the insolvency of the insurance company for the purposes of this chapter, and if the insurance company is adjudged to be bankrupt or insolvent by a court of competent jurisdiction, proceedings may be brought by the employee against the employer in the first instance or against the employer and the insurance company jointly or severally or in a pending proceeding against the insurance company, and the employer may be joined at any time after the adjudication. (g) Employer bill of rights - Penalty. (1) Every insurance carrier and self-insurer, individual and group, shall, on written request of the insured employer, provide the employer with a list of claims made against the employer. The information provided to the employer shall include amounts paid for closed claims and, if requested, details regarding the treatment and condition of the injured or disabled worker. The employer shall also receive notice of any proposed settlement of any claim against the employer if the employer so requests in writing. (2) In the event the court determines and makes a finding that a worker has filed a fraudulent claim for workers' compensation benefits under this amendatory act, Section 25-5-11.1 shall not apply to the employer. In addition to the denial of workers' compensation benefits under this amendatory act, the employer, upon such a finding that a worker has filed a fraudulent claim for workers' compensation benefits under this amendatory act, may terminate the worker. (3) Failure to comply with subdivision (1) may subject the violator to a fine, upon hearing by a court, of not less than $25.00 nor more than $100.00.

(25-5-1 through 25-5-17)--->25-5-11 Actions against third parties jointly liable with employers for injuries or death; actions for injury or death resulting from willful conduct; attorney's fees in settlements with third parties. 
===================================================================

 
Section 25-5-11 Actions against third parties jointly liable with employers for injuries or death; actions for injury or death resulting from willful conduct; attorney's fees in settlements with third parties. (a) If the injury or death for which compensation is payable under Articles 3 or 4 of this chapter was caused under circumstances also creating a legal liability for damages on the part of any party other than the employer, whether or not the party is subject to this chapter, the employee, or his or her dependents in case of death, may proceed against the employer to recover compensation under this chapter or may agree with the employer upon the compensation payable under this chapter, and at the same time, may bring an action against the other party to recover damages for the injury or death, and the amount of the damages shall be ascertained and determined without regard to this chapter. If a party, other than the employer, is a workers' compensation insurance carrier of the employer or any person, firm, association, trust, fund, or corporation responsible for servicing and payment of workers' compensation claims for the employer, or any officer, director, agent, or employee of the carrier, person, firm, association, trust, fund, or corporation, or is a labor union, or any official or representative thereof, or is a governmental agency providing occupational safety and health services, or an employee of the agency, or is an officer, director, agent, or employee of the same employer, or his or her personal representative, the injured employee, or his or her dependents in the case of death, may bring an action against any workers' compensation insurance carrier of the employer or any person, firm, association, trust, fund, or corporation responsible for servicing and payment of workers' compensation claims for the employer, labor union, or the governmental agency, or person, or his or her personal representative, only for willful conduct which results in or proximately causes the injury or death. If the injured employee, or in case of death, his or her dependents, recovers damages against the other party, the amount of the damages recovered and collected shall be credited upon the liability of the employer for compensation. If the damages recovered and collected are in excess of the compensation payable under this chapter, there shall be no further liability on the employer to pay compensation on account of the injury or death. To the extent of the recovery of damages against the other party, the employer shall be entitled to reimbursement for the amount of compensation theretofore paid on account of injury or death. If the employee who recovers damages is receiving or entitled to receive compensation for permanent total disability, then the employer shall be entitled to reimbursement for the amount of compensation theretofore paid, and the employer's obligation to pay further compensation for permanent total disability shall be suspended for the number of weeks which equals the quotient of the total damage recovery, less the amount of any reimbursement for compensation already paid, divided by the amount of the weekly benefit for permanent total disability which the employee was receiving or to which the employee was entitled. For purposes of this amendatory act, the employer shall be entitled to subrogation for medical and vocational benefits expended by the employer on behalf of the employee; however, if a judgment in an action brought pursuant to this section is uncollectible in part, the employer's entitlement to subrogation for such medical and vocational benefits shall be in proportion to the ratio the amount of the judgment collected bears to the total amount of the judgment. (b) If personal injury or death to any employee results from the willful conduct, as defined in subsection (c) herein, of any officer, director, agent, or employee of the same employer or any workers' compensation insurance carrier of the employer or any person, firm, association, trust, fund, or corporation responsible for servicing any payment of workers' compensation claims for the employer, or any officer, director, agent, or employee of the carrier, person, firm, association, trust, fund, or corporation, or of a labor union, or an official or representative thereof, the employee shall have a cause of action against the person, workers' compensation carrier, or labor union. (c) As used herein, "willful conduct" means any of the following: (1) A purpose or intent or design to injure another; and if a person, with knowledge of the danger or peril to another, consciously pursues a course of conduct with a design, intent, and purpose of inflicting injury, then he or she is guilty of "willful conduct." (2) The willful and intentional removal from a machine of a safety guard or safety device provided by the manufacturer of the machine with knowledge that injury or death would likely or probably result from the removal; provided, however, that removal of a guard or device shall not be willful conduct unless the removal did, in fact, increase the danger in the use of the machine and was not done for the purpose of repair of the machine or was not part of an improvement or modification of the machine which rendered the safety device unnecessary or ineffective. (3) The intoxication of another employee of the employer if the conduct of that employee has wrongfully and proximately caused injury or death to the plaintiff or plaintiff's decedent, but no employee shall be guilty of willful conduct on account of the intoxication of another employee or another person. (4) Willful and intentional violation of a specific written safety rule of the employer after written notice to the violating employee by another employee who, within six months after the date of receipt of the written notice, suffers injury resulting in death or permanent total disability as a proximate result of the willful and intentional violation. The written notice to the violating employee shall state with specificity all of the following: a. The identity of the violating employee. b. The specific written safety rule being violated and the manner of the violation. c. That the violating employee has repeatedly and continually violated the specific written safety rule referred to in b. above with specific reference to previous times, dates, and circumstances. d. That the violation places the notifying employee at risk of great injury or death. A notice that does not contain all of the above elements shall not be valid notice for purposes of this section. An employee shall not be liable for the willful conduct if the injured employee himself or herself violated a safety rule, or otherwise contributed to his or her own injury. No employee shall be held liable under this section for the violation of any safety rule by any other employee or for failing to prevent any violation by any other employee. (d) In the event the injured employee, or his or her dependents, in case of death, do not file a civil action against the other party to recover damages within the time allowed by law, the employer or the insurance carrier for the employer shall be allowed an additional period of six months within which to bring a civil action against the other party for damages on account of the injury or death. In the event the employer or the insurance carrier has paid compensation to the employee or his or her dependent, or in the event a proceeding is pending against the employer to require the payment of the compensation, the civil action may be maintained either in the name of the injured employee, his or her dependent in case of death, the employer, or the insurance carrier. In the event the damages recovered in the civil action are in excess of the compensation payable by the employer under this chapter and costs, attorney's fees, and reasonable expenses incurred by the employer in making the collection, the excess of the amount shall be held in trust for the injured employee or, in case of death, for the employee's dependents. If the injured employee has no dependent, the personal representative, in the event of death, may bring a civil action against the other party to recover damages without regard to this chapter. (e) In a settlement made under this section with a third party by the employee or, in case of death, by his or her dependents, the employer shall be liable for that part of the attorney's fees incurred in the settlement with the third party, with or without a civil action, in the same proportion that the amount of the reduction in the employer's liability to pay compensation bears to the total recovery had from the third party. For purposes of the subrogation provisions of this subsection only, "compensation" includes medical expenses, as defined in Section 25-5-77, if and only if the employer is entitled to subrogation for medical expenses under subsection (a) of this section. (f) For the purpose of this section, a carrier, person, firm, association, trust, fund, or corporation includes a company or a governmental agency making a safety inspection on behalf of a self-insured employer or its employees, and an officer, director, agent, or employee of the company or a governmental agency.

===================================================================

 
 Section 25-5-14 
Section 25-5-14 Legislative findings and intent as to actions filed by injured employee against officers, etc., of same employer.
The Legislature finds that actions filed on behalf of injured employees against officers, directors, agents, servants or employees of the same employer seeking to recover damages in excess of amounts received or receivable from the employer under the workers' compensation statutes of this state and predicated upon claimed negligent or wanton conduct resulting in injuries arising out of and in the course of employment are contrary to the intent of the Legislature in adopting a comprehensive workers' compensation scheme and are producing a debilitating and adverse effect upon efforts to retain existing, and to attract new industry to this state. Specifically, the existence of such causes of action places this state at a serious disadvantage in comparison to the existing laws of other states with whom this state competes in seeking to attract and retain industrial operations which would provide better job opportunities and increased employment for people in this state. The existence of such causes of action, and the consequent litigation resulting therefrom, results in substantial costs and expenses to employers which, as a practical matter, must either procure additional liability insurance coverage for supervisory and management employees or fund the costs of defense, judgment or settlement from their own resources in order to retain competent and reliable personnel. The existence of such causes of action has a disruptive effect upon the relationship among employees and supervisory and management personnel. There is a total absence of any reliable evidence that the availability of such causes of action has resulted in any reduction of the number or severity of on-the-job accidents or of any substantial improvement on providing safe working conditions and work practices. The intent of the Legislature is to provide complete immunity to employers and limited immunity to officers, directors, agents, servants or employees of the same employer and to the workers' compensation insurance carrier and compensation service companies of the employer or any officer, director, agent, servant or employee of such carrier or company and to labor unions and to any official or representative thereof, from civil liability for all causes of action except those based on willful conduct and such immunity is an essential aspect of the workers' compensation scheme. The Legislature hereby expressly reaffirms its intent, as set forth in Section 25-5-53, as amended herein, and Sections 25-5-144 and 25-5-194, regarding the exclusivity of the rights and remedies of an injured employee, except as provided for herein.

Section 25-5-15 Safety committee.
Upon the written request of any employee, each employer subject to the workers' compensation law shall appoint a safety committee. The safety committee shall consist of not less than three committee members, one of whom must be a nonsupervisory employee. The safety committee shall advise the employer regarding safety in the work place, including suggestions from employees regarding safety conditions in the work place. Any employee shall have the right to notify the safety committee of a safety condition in the work place. The safety committee shall develop procedures by which an employee may give such notification. The provisions of this section shall not apply to any employer who now or in the future has an established safety committee pursuant to contract or agreement with its employees or their representative.

Emphasis shall be placed on unsafe acts in both small industry and high risk industry.
(c) Qualified safety management specialists shall be employed in the safe state program to assist employers in developing or improving their safety programs.

(c) An employee whose duties require him to travel regularly in the service of his employer in this and one or more other states may, by written agreement with his employer, provide that his employment is principally localized in this or another such state; and, unless such other state refuses jurisdiction, such agreement shall be given effect under this section. (d) If an employee, while working outside of this state, suffers an injury on account of which he or, in the event of his death, his dependents, would have been entitled to the benefits provided by this article and Article 3 of this chapter had such injury occurred within this state, such employee or, in the event of his death resulting from such injury, his dependents, shall be entitled to the benefits provided by this article and Article 3 of this chapter, provided that at the time of such injury: (1) His employment was principally localized in this state; (2) He was working under a contract of hire made in this state in employment not principally localized in any state; (3) He was working under a contract of hire made in this state in employment principally localized in another state whose workmen's compensation law was not applicable to his employer; or (4) He was working under a contract of hire made in this state for employment outside the United States. (e) The payment or award of benefits under the workers' compensation law of another state, territory, province or foreign nation to an employee or his dependents otherwise entitled on account of such injury or death to the benefits of this article and Article 3 of this chapter shall not be a bar to a claim for benefits under this article and Article 3 of this chapter; provided that claim under this article is filed within the time limits set forth in Section 25-5-80. If compensation is paid or awarded under this article and Article 3 of this chapter: (1) The medical and related benefits furnished or paid for by the employer under such other workers' compensation law on account of such injury or death shall be credited against the medical and related benefits to which the employee would have been entitled under this article and Article 3 of this chapter had claim been made solely under this article and Article 3 of this chapter; (2) The total amount of compensation paid or awarded the employee under such other workers' compensation law shall be credited against the total amount of compensation which would have been due the employee under this article and Article 3 of this chapter, had claim been made solely under this article and Article 3 of this chapter; and (3) The total amount of death benefits paid or awarded under such other workers' compensation law shall be credited against the total amount of death benefits due under this article and Article 3 of this chapter. (f) The recovery of any compensation benefits under the law of any other state shall bar any common-law or statutory right of action for damages that an employee or his dependents might otherwise have had against the employer or the officers, directors or employees of the employer as a result of the injury or death on account of which such compensation benefits were paid. (g) If, as a result of an employment principally localized in another state, an employee of an employer who would have been subject to this article or Article 3 of this chapter, had the contract of employment been entered into in this state for performance in this state, suffers injury or death as a result of an accident occurring in this state, compensation and medical, surgical and hospital benefits on account of such injury or death may be recovered under this article or Article 3 of this chapter.

===================================================================

 
 Section 25-5-51 
Section 25-5-51 Right to compensation for injuries or death; grounds for denial of compensation.
If an employer is subject to this article, compensation, according to the schedules hereinafter contained, shall be paid by the employer, or those conducting the business during bankruptcy or insolvency, in every case of personal injury or death of his or her employee caused by an accident arising out of and in the course of his or her employment, without regard to any question of negligence. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no compensation shall be allowed for an injury or death caused by the willful misconduct of the employee, by the employee's intention to bring about the injury or death of himself or herself or of another, his or her willful failure or willful refusal to use safety appliances provided by the employer or by an accident due to the injured employee being intoxicated from the use of alcohol or being impaired by illegal drugs.
A positive drug test conducted and evaluated pursuant to standards adopted for drug testing by the U.S. Department of Transportation in 49 C.F.R. Part 40 shall be a conclusive presumption of impairment resulting from the use of illegal drugs. No compensation shall be allowed if the employee refuses to submit to or cooperate with a blood or urine test as set forth above after the accident after being warned in writing by the employer that such refusal would forfeit the employee's right to recover benefits under this chapter.
No compensation shall be allowed if, at the time of or in the course of entering into employment or at the time of receiving notice of the removal of conditions from a conditional offer of employment, the employee knowingly and falsely misrepresents in writing his or her physical or mental condition and the condition is aggravated or reinjured in an accident arising out of and in the course of his or her employment.
At the time an employer makes an unconditional offer of employment or removes conditions previously placed on a conditional offer of employment, the employer shall provide the employee with the following written warning in bold type print, "Misrepresentations as to preexisting physical or mental conditions may void your workers' compensation benefits." If the employer defends on the ground that the injury arose in any or all of the last above stated ways, the burden of proof shall be on the employer to establish the defense.

No settlement for an amount less than the amounts or benefits stipulated in this article shall be valid for any purpose, unless a judge of the court where the claim for compensation under this chapter is entitled to be made, or upon the written consent of the parties, a judge of the court determines that it is for the best interest of the employee or the employee's dependent to accept a lesser sum and approves the settlement. The court shall not approve any settlement unless and until it has first made inquiry into the bona fides of a claimant's claim and the liability of the defendant; and if deemed advisable, the court may hold a hearing thereon. Settlements made may be vacated for fraud, undue influence, or coercion, upon application made to the judge approving the settlement at any time not later than six months after the date of settlement.

In order to encourage advance payments, it is expressly provided that the payments shall not be construed as an admission of liability but shall be without prejudice.

===================================================================

 
 Section 25-5-57 
Section 25-5-57 Compensation for disability.
(a) Compensation schedule. Following is the schedule of compensation:
(1) TEMPORARY TOTAL DISABILITY. For injury producing temporary total disability, the compensation shall be 66 2/3 percent of the average weekly earnings received at the time of injury, subject to a maximum and minimum weekly compensation as stated in Section 25-5-68, but if at the time of injury the employee received average weekly earnings of less than the minimum stated in Section 25-5-68, then he or she shall receive the full amount of the average weekly earnings per week. This compensation shall be paid during the time of the disability, but at the time as a temporary total disability shall become permanent, compensation for the continued total disability shall be governed by (a)(4) of this section with respect to permanent total disability. Payments are to be made at the intervals when the earnings were payable, as nearly as may be, unless the parties otherwise agree.
(2) TEMPORARY PARTIAL DISABILITY.
a. Amount and Duration of Compensation. For temporary partial disability, the compensation shall be 66 2/3 percent of the difference between the average weekly earnings of the worker at the time of the injury and the average weekly earnings he or she is able to earn in his or her partially disabled condition. This compensation shall be paid during the period of the disability, but not beyond 300 weeks. Payments shall be made at the intervals when the earnings were payable, as nearly as may be, unless the parties otherwise agree, and shall be subject to the same maximum weekly compensation as stated in Section 25-5-68.
b. Effect of Change in Employment. If the injured employee who is receiving compensation for temporary partial disability leaves the employment of the employer by whom he or she was employed at the time of the accident for which the compensation is being paid, he or she shall, upon securing employment elsewhere, give to the former employer an affidavit in writing containing the name of his or her new employer, the place of employment, and the amount of wages being received at the new employment, and until he or she gives the affidavit, the compensation for temporary partial disability shall cease. The employer for whom the employee was employed at the time of the accident for which the compensation is being paid may also at any time demand of the employee an additional affidavit, in writing, containing the name of his or her employer, the place of his or her employment, and the amount of wages he or she is receiving; and if the employee upon demand fails or refuses to make and furnish the affidavit, his or her right to compensation for temporary partial disability shall cease until the affidavit is made and furnished.
(3) PERMANENT PARTIAL DISABILITY.
a. Amount and Duration of Compensation. For permanent partial disability, the compensation shall be based upon the extent of the disability. In cases included in the following schedule, the compensation shall be 66 2/3 percent of the average weekly earnings, during the number of weeks set out in the following schedule:
1. For the loss of a thumb, 62 weeks.
2. For the loss of a first finger, commonly called the index finger, 43 weeks.
3. For the loss of a second finger, 31 weeks.
4. For the loss of a third finger, 22 weeks.
5. For the loss of a fourth finger, commonly called the little finger, 16 weeks.
6. The loss of the first phalange of the thumb or of any finger shall be considered as equal to the loss of one half of the thumb or finger, and compensation shall be paid at the prescribed rate during one half of the time specified above for the thumb or finger.
7. The loss of two or more phalanges shall be considered as the loss of the entire finger or thumb, but in no case shall the amount received for more than one finger exceed the amount provided in this schedule for the loss of a hand.
8. For the loss of a great toe, 32 weeks.
9. For the loss of any of the toes other than the great toe, 11 weeks.
10. The loss of the first phalange of any toe shall be considered to be equal to the loss of one half of the toe, and compensation shall be paid at the prescribed rate during one half the time prescribed above for the toe.
11. The loss of two or more phalanges shall be considered as the loss of an entire toe.
12. For the loss of a hand, 170 weeks.
13. For the loss of an arm, 222 weeks.
14. For the loss of a foot, 139 weeks.
15. Amputation between the elbow and wrist shall be considered as the equivalent to the loss of a hand, and amputation between the knee and ankle shall be considered as the equivalent of the loss of a foot.
16. For the loss of a leg, 200 weeks.
17. For the loss of an eye, 124 weeks.
18. For the complete and permanent loss of hearing in both ears, 163 weeks.
19. For the complete and permanent loss of hearing in one ear, 53 weeks.
20. For the loss of an eye and a leg, 350 weeks.
21. For the loss of an eye and one arm, 350 weeks.

25. For the loss of two hands, 400 weeks.
26. For the loss of two legs, 400 weeks.
27. For the loss of two feet, 400 weeks.
28. For the loss of one arm and the other hand, 400 weeks.
29. For the loss of one hand and one foot, 400 weeks.
30. For the loss of one leg and the other foot, 400 weeks.
31. For the loss of one hand and one leg, 400 weeks.
32. For the loss of one arm and one foot, 400 weeks.
33. For the loss of one arm and one leg, 400 weeks.
34. For serious disfigurement, not resulting from the loss of a member or other injury specifically compensated, materially affecting the employability of the injured person in the employment in which he or she was injured or other employment for which he or she is then qualified, 66 2/3 percent of the average weekly earnings for the period as the court may determine, but not exceeding 100 weeks.
b. Successive or Concurrent Temporary Total and Permanent Partial Disabilities Resulting from Same Injury. When a permanent partial disability, the number of weeks compensation for which is scheduled in subdivision (a)(3) of this section, follows or accompanies a period of temporary total disability resulting from the same injury, the number of weeks of the temporary total disability shall not be deducted from the number of weeks payable for the permanent partial disability.
c. Concurrent Disabilities. If an employee sustains concurrent injuries resulting in concurrent disabilities, he or she shall receive compensation only for the injury which entitled him or her to the largest amount of compensation, but this paragraph shall not affect liability for the concurrent loss of more than one member for which members compensation is provided in the specific schedule.
d. Loss of Use of Member. The permanent and total loss of the use of a member shall be considered as equivalent to the loss of that member, but in such cases the compensation specified in the schedule for such injury shall be in lieu of all other compensation, except as otherwise provided herein. For permanent disability due to injury to a member resulting in less than total loss of use of the member not otherwise compensated in this schedule, compensation shall be paid at the prescribed rate during that part of the time specified in the schedule for the total loss or total loss of use of the respective member which the extent of the injury to the member bears to its total loss.
e. Effect of Refusal of Suitable Employment. If an injured employee refuses employment suitable to his or her capacity offered to or procured for him or her, he or she shall not be entitled to any compensation at any time during the continuance of the refusal, unless at any time, in the opinion of the judge of the circuit court of the county of his or her residence, the refusal is justifiable.
f. Maximum and Minimum Compensation Awards. Compensation provided in this subsection (a) for loss of members or loss of use of members is subject to the same limitations as to maximum and minimum weekly compensation as stated in Section 25-5-68.
g. Compensation for Permanent Partial Disabilities Not Enumerated. For all other permanent partial disabilities not above enumerated, the compensation shall be 66 2/3 percent of the difference between the average weekly earnings of the worker at the time of the injury and the average weekly earnings he or she is able to earn in his or her partially disabled condition, subject to the same maximum weekly compensation as stated in Section 25-5-68. If a permanent partial disability, compensation for which is not calculated by use of the schedule in subdivision (a)(3) of this section, follows a period of temporary total disability resulting from the same injury, the number of weeks of the temporary total disability shall be deducted from the number of weeks payable for the permanent partial disability. Compensation shall continue during disability, but not beyond 300 weeks.
h. Affidavit of New Employment. If the injured employee leaves the services of the employer for whom he or she was working at the time of the accident and accepts employment elsewhere, he or she shall make and furnish affidavit as to his or her new employment in the manner as required in (a)(2) of this section.
i. Return to Work. If, on or after the date of maximum medical improvement, except for scheduled injuries as provided in Section 25-5-57(a)(3), an injured worker returns to work at a wage equal to or greater than the worker's pre-injury wage, the worker's permanent partial disability rating shall be equal to his or her physical impairment and the court shall not consider any evidence of vocational disability. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the employee has lost his or her employment under circumstances other than any of the following within a period of time not to exceed 300 weeks from the date of injury, an employee may petition a court within two years thereof for reconsideration of his or her permanent partial disability rating:
(i) The loss of employment is due to a labor dispute still in active progress in the establishment in which he or she is or was last employed. For the purposes of this section only, the term "labor dispute" includes any controversy concerning terms, tenure, or conditions of employment, or concerning the association or representation of persons in negotiating, fixing, maintaining, changing, or seeking to arrange terms or conditions of employment, regardless of whether the disputants stand in the proximate relation of employer and employee. This definition shall not relate to a dispute between an individual worker and his or her employer.
(ii) The loss of employment is voluntary, without good cause connected with such work.
(iii) The loss of employment is for a dishonest or criminal act committed in connection with his or her work, for sabotage, or an act endangering the safety of others.
(iv) The loss of employment is for actual or threatened misconduct committed in connection with his or her work after previous warning to the employee.
(v) The loss of employment is because a license, certificate, permit, bond, or surety which is necessary for the performance of such employment and which he or she is responsible to supply has been revoked, suspended, or otherwise become lost to him or her for a cause.
The burden of proof is on the employer to prove, by clear and convincing evidence, that an employee's loss of employment was due to one of the causes (i) through (v) above. At the hearing, the court may consider evidence as to the earnings the employee is or may be able to earn in his or her partially disabled condition, and may consider any evidence of vocational disability. The fact the employee had returned to work prior to his or her loss of employment shall not constitute a presumption of no vocational impairment. In making this evaluation, the court shall consider the permanent restriction, if any, imposed by the treating physician under Section 25-5-77, as well as all available reasonable accommodations that would enable the employee in his or her condition following the accident or onset of occupational disease to perform jobs that he or she in that condition otherwise would be unable to perform, and shall treat an employee able to perform with such accommodation as though he or she could perform without the accommodation. Nothing contained in this section shall be construed as having any effect upon any evidentiary issues or claims made in third party actions pursuant to Section 25-5-11.
(4) PERMANENT TOTAL DISABILITY.
a. Amount, Duration, and Payment of Compensation. For permanent total disability, as defined in paragraph d. of this subdivision, the employee shall receive 66 2/3 percent of the average weekly earnings received at the time of the injury, subject to a maximum and minimum weekly compensation as stated in Section 25-5-68. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if at the time of injury the employee was receiving earnings of less than the minimum as stated in Section 25-5-68, then he or she shall receive the full amount of his or her earnings per week. This compensation shall be paid during the permanent total disability, as defined in paragraph d. of this subdivision. Payment of the compensation shall be made at the intervals when the earnings were payable, as nearly as may be, unless the parties otherwise agree. The payments, with the approval of the circuit judge or by the agreement of the parties, may be made monthly, quarterly, or otherwise as the parties may agree. Payments for permanent total disability shall not be ordered to be paid in a lump sum without the consent of both the employer and the employee.
b. Alteration, Amendment, or Revision of Compensation. At any time, the employer may petition the court that awarded or approved compensation for permanent total disability to alter, amend, or revise the award or approval of the compensation on the ground that as a result of physical or vocational rehabilitation, or otherwise, the disability from which the employee suffers is no longer a permanent total disability and, if the court is so satisfied after a hearing, it shall alter, amend, or revise the award accordingly. If compensation for permanent total disability is being paid pursuant to a written agreement between employer and employee without approval, the employer may make application to the court that would have had jurisdiction to award the compensation to the employee to alter, amend, or revise the agreement on such grounds. If an employee is receiving benefits for permanent total disability other than as a result of an award or a written agreement between the employer and employee and if the employer terminates the payment of the benefits, the employee may, within two years of the last payment, petition the court to reinstate the benefits and, upon a showing that the permanent total disability still exists, shall be entitled to have the benefits reinstated effective the date of the last payment.
c. Employees in Public Institutions. In case an employee who is permanently and totally disabled becomes an inmate of a public institution, no compensation shall be payable unless the employee has wholly dependent on him or her for support a person or persons named in Sections 25-5-61 and 25-5-62, whose dependency shall be determined as if the employee were deceased, in which case the compensation provided for in this subdivision shall be paid for the benefit of the person so dependent, during dependency, in the manner so ordered by the court, while the employee is an inmate in the institution. Nothing contained herein shall be construed to deprive a permanently and totally disabled employee who has no dependent named in Sections 25-5-61 and 25-5-62 from receiving benefits to which he or she would otherwise be entitled if the employee, although an inmate of a public institution, is paying or on whose behalf funds are paid from any source to the public institution the normal and customary charge for the services rendered by the public institution. Normal and customary charge shall mean that charge actually made by the public institution to persons able to pay for the services rendered them whether the charge actually covers the expense of the upkeep of the inmate or not. If the employee has had a guardian appointed by a court of competent jurisdiction, the workers' compensation payments shall be directly paid to the guardian.
d. Definition. The total and permanent loss of the sight of both eyes or the loss of both arms at the shoulder or any physical injury or mental impairment resulting from an accident, which injury or impairment permanently and totally incapacitates the employee from working at and being retrained for gainful employment, shall constitute prima facie evidence of permanent total disability but shall not constitute the sole basis on which an award of permanent total disability may be based. Any employee whose disability results from an injury or impairment and who shall have refused to undergo physical or vocational rehabilitation or to accept reasonable accommodation shall not be deemed permanently and totally disabled.
e. Second Permanent Injuries Generally. If an employee has a permanent disability or has previously sustained another injury than that in which the employee received a subsequent permanent injury by accident, as is specified in this section defining permanent injury, the employee shall be entitled to compensation only for the degree of injury that would have resulted from the latter accident if the earlier disability or injury had not existed.
f. Second Permanent Injury in Same Employment Resulting in Permanent Total Disability. If an employee receives a permanent injury as specified in this section after having sustained another permanent injury in the same employment, and if the previous and subsequent injuries result in permanent total disability, compensation shall be payable for permanent total disability only.
g. Concurrent Compensation Payments. If an employee receives an injury for which compensation is payable while he or she is still receiving or entitled to receive compensation for a previous injury in the same employment, he or she shall not at the same time be entitled to compensation for both injuries, unless the later injury is a permanent injury, as specified in this section, but he or she shall be entitled to compensation for that injury and from the time of that injury which will cover the longest period and the largest amount payable under this article and Article 4 of this chapter.
If an employee receives a permanent injury as specified in this section, after having sustained another permanent injury in the same employment, he or she shall be entitled to compensation for both injuries, subject to paragraph e. of this subdivision, but the total compensation shall be paid by extending the period and not by increasing the amount of weekly compensation, and in no case for permanent partial disability exceeding 700 weeks.
h. Effect of Rehabilitation or Recovery on Permanent Total Disability Benefits. If an employee who is receiving benefits for permanent total disability shall, as a result of physical or vocational rehabilitation or otherwise, obtain gainful employment, the obligation to pay permanent total disability benefits shall thereupon terminate; provided, that at any time that the employee's weekly wage from the employment shall be less than the employee's average weekly wage at the time of injury, the employer shall remain obligated to pay to the employee as compensation an amount equal to 66 2/3 percent of the difference, subject to each of the following limitations:
1. The employer's liability for the payment of 66 2/3 percent of the difference shall continue for 200 weeks from the date of reemployment or 300 weeks from the date of injury, whichever is the longer period.
2. In no event shall the amount of weekly benefits paid by the employer to the employee exceed the weekly benefit the employee was receiving for permanent total disability.
3. No payments shall be due for any week the employee earns as much as or more than his or her average weekly wage at the time of injury. If the employee who obtains gainful employment suffered a permanent partial disability as specified in subsection (a), subdivision (3) of this section, the total amount of compensation paid for permanent total disability shall not be less than that amount which would have been payable for the permanent partial disability.
i. Affidavit of Gainful Employment. If an employee who is receiving benefits for permanent total disability shall, as the result of physical or vocational rehabilitation, accommodation, or otherwise, obtain gainful employment with an employer other than with his or her former employer, he or she shall, upon securing employment, give to his or her former employer an affidavit in writing containing the name of his or her new employer, the place of employment and the amount of wages being received at the new employment. Until he or she gives the affidavit, the compensation for permanent total disability shall cease. The employer for whom the employee was employed at the time of the accident for which compensation is being paid may also at any time demand of the employee additional affidavit, in writing, containing the name of his or her employer, the place of his or her employment, and the amount of wages he or she is receiving. If the employee, upon demand, fails or refuses to make and furnish the affidavit, his or her rights to compensation shall cease until the affidavit is made and furnished.
(5) DEATH FOLLOWING DISABILITY. If an employee sustains an injury occasioned by an accident arising out of and in the course of his or her employment and, during the period of disability caused thereby, death results proximately therefrom, all payments previously made as compensation for the injury shall be deducted from the compensation, if any, due on account of death. If an employee who sustains a permanent partial or permanent total disability, the degree of which has been agreed upon by the parties or has been ascertained by the court, and death results not proximately therefrom, the employee's surviving spouse or dependent children or both shall be entitled to the balance of the payments which would have been due and payable to the worker, whether or not the decedent employee was receiving compensation for permanent total disability, not exceeding, however, the amount that would have been due the surviving spouse or dependent children or both if death had resulted proximately from an injury on account of which compensation is being paid to an employee.
(6) HERNIA.
a. Proof. For hernia resulting from injury by an accident arising out of and in the course of the employee's employment, it must be definitely proven to the satisfaction of the court all of the following:
1. That there was an injury resulting in hernia.
2. That the hernia appeared suddenly.
3. That it was accompanied by pain.
4. That the hernia immediately followed an accident.
5. That the hernia did not exist prior to the accident for which compensation is claimed.
b. Treatment. All hernia, inguinal, femoral, or otherwise, proved to be the result of an injury by accident arising out of and in the course of the employment, shall be treated in a surgical manner by radical operation. If the injured employee refuses to undergo the radical operation for the cure of the hernia, no compensation will be allowed during the time the refusal continues. If, however, it is shown that the employee has some chronic disease or is otherwise in physical condition that the court considers it unsafe for the employee to undergo the operation, the employee shall be paid as otherwise provided in this chapter.
(b) Computation of compensation; determination of average weekly earnings. Compensation under this section shall be computed on the basis of the average weekly earnings. Average weekly earnings shall be based on the wages, as defined in Section 25-5-1(6) of the injured employee in the employment in which he or she was working at the time of the injury during the period of 52 weeks immediately preceding the date of the injury divided by 52, but if the injured employee lost more than seven consecutive calendar days during the period, although not in the same week, then the earnings for the remainder of the period, although not in the same week, then the earnings for the remainder of the 52 weeks shall be divided by the number of weeks remaining after the time so lost has been deducted. Where the employment prior to the injury extended over a period of less than 52 weeks, the method of dividing the earnings during that period by the number of weeks and parts thereof during which the employee earned wages shall be followed, provided results just and fair to both parties will thereby be obtained. Where by reason of the shortness of the time during which the employee has been in the employment of his or her employer or the casual nature or terms of the employment it is impracticable to compute the average weekly earnings as above defined, regard shall be had to the average weekly amount which during the 52 weeks prior to the injury was being earned by a person in the same grade, employed at the same work by the same employer, and if there is no person so employed, by a person in the same grade employed in the same class of employment in the same district. Whatever allowances of any character made to an employee in lieu of wages are specified as part of the wage contract shall be deemed a part of his or her earnings.
(c) Setoff for other recovery. In calculating the amount of workers' compensation due:
(1) The employer may reduce or accept an assignment from an employee of the amount of benefits paid pursuant to a disability plan, retirement plan, or other plan providing for sick pay by the amount of compensation paid, if and only if the employer provided the benefits or paid for the plan or plans providing the benefits deducted.
(2) The employee shall forfeit to the employer all compensation paid for any period to which is attributed any award of back pay either by a court, administrative agency, arbitration, or settlement, provided, however, social security payments shall not be included herein.
(3) If an employer continues the salary of an injured employee during the benefit period or pays similar compensation during the benefit period, the employer shall be allowed a setoff in weeks against the compensation owed under this article. For the purposes of this section, voluntary contributions to a Section 125-cafeteria plan for a disability or sick pay program shall not be considered as being provided by the employer.

(a) For purposes of this article, except for scheduled injuries as provided in Section 25-5-57(a)(3), compensation for the first three days of disability shall not be payable, nor shall compensation be paid in any case unless the employer has actual knowledge of the injury or is notified thereof within the period specified in Section 25-5-78.
(b) Compensation shall begin with the fourth day after disability, and if the disability from the injury exists for a period as much as 21 days, compensation for the first three days after the injury shall be added to and payable with the first installment due the employee after the expiration of the 21 days. If any installment of compensation payable is not paid without good cause within 30 days after it becomes due, there shall be added to the unpaid installment an amount equal to 15 percent thereof, which shall be paid at the same time as, but in addition to, the installment.

===================================================================

 
 Section 25-5-60 
Section 25-5-60 Compensation for death.
In death cases, where the death results proximately from the accident within three years, compensation payable to dependents shall be computed on the following basis and shall be paid to the persons entitled thereto without administration, or to a guardian or other person as the court may direct, for the use and benefit of the person entitled thereto.
(1) PERSONS ENTITLED TO BENEFITS; AMOUNT OF BENEFITS.
a. If the deceased employee leaves one dependent, there shall be paid to the dependent 50 percent of the average weekly earnings of the deceased.
b. If the deceased employee leaves two or more dependents, there shall be paid to the dependents 66 2/3 percent of the average weekly earnings of the deceased.
c. If one of two or more dependents is a widow or widower, the compensation may be paid to the widow or widower for the benefit of herself or himself and the dependent child or children. In its discretion and when it considers appropriate to do so, the court shall at any time have the power to determine, without the appointment of any guardian or guardians, what portion of the compensation shall be applied for the benefit of any child or children and may order the same paid to a guardian or custodian of the child or children.
d. Partial dependents shall be entitled to receive only that proportion of the benefits provided for total dependents which the average amount of the earnings regularly contributed by the deceased employee to the partial dependent, at and for a reasonable time immediately prior to the injury, bore to the total income of the dependent during the same time. If there is one dependent and one or more partial dependents and the dependent is not entitled to the maximum amount of compensation provided in Section 25-5-68, there shall be paid to the partial dependent or partial dependents that percentage of the benefit paid to a full dependent which the contribution of the decedent to the partial dependent's support bears to the total income of the partial dependent. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the compensation payable to the partial dependent or dependents shall not exceed the lesser of 16 2/3 percent of the decedent's average weekly wage or the difference between the compensation payable to the full dependent and the maximum weekly compensation benefit payable as provided in Section 25-5-68.
e. If compensation is being paid under this article to any dependent, the compensation shall cease upon the death or marriage of the dependent, unless otherwise provided in this article.
f. Upon the cessation of compensation to or for any dependent, for any cause, the compensation of the remaining dependents entitled to compensation shall, for the unexpired period during which their compensation is payable, be that which would have been payable to them had they been the only persons entitled to compensation at the time of death of the deceased employee.
g. If, however, the deceased employee at the time of his or her death has no dependents as herein defined, then within 60 days of his or her death, the employer shall pay a one-time lump sum payment of seven thousand five hundred dollars ($7,500) to the deceased worker's estate.
(2) MAXIMUM AND MINIMUM COMPENSATION AWARDS. - The compensation payable in case of death to persons wholly dependent shall be subject to a maximum and minimum weekly compensation as stated in Section 25-5-68, but if at the time of injury the employee receives earnings of less than the minimum stated in Section 25-5-68, then the compensation shall be the full amount of such earnings per week. The compensation payable to partial dependents shall be subject to a maximum and minimum weekly compensation as stated in Section 25-5-68, but if the income loss of the partial dependents by the death is less than the minimum weekly compensation stated in Section 25-5-68, then the dependents shall receive the full amount of their income loss. This compensation shall be paid during dependency, not exceeding 500 weeks. Payments shall be made at the intervals when the earnings were payable, as nearly as may be, unless the parties otherwise agree.

 Section 25-5-68 
Section 25-5-68 Maximum and minimum weekly compensation.
(a) The compensation paid under this article shall be not less than, except as otherwise provided in this article, 27 1/2 percent of the average weekly wage of the state as determined by the director, rounded to the nearest dollar, pursuant to subsection (b) of this section and, in any event, no more than 100 percent of the average weekly wage. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the maximum compensation payable for permanent partial disability shall be no more than the lesser of $220.00 per week or 100 percent of the average weekly wage.
(b) For the purpose of this section, the average weekly wage of the state shall be determined by the director as follows: On or before June 1 of each year, the total wages reported on contribution reports to the unemployment compensation division of the department for the preceding calendar year shall be divided by the average monthly number of insured workers, which shall be determined by dividing the sum of the number of insured workers reported for each month of the preceding year by 12. The average annual wage thus obtained shall be divided by 52, and the average weekly wage thus determined rounded to the nearest cent. The average weekly wage as so determined shall be applicable for the 12-month period beginning July 1 following the June 1 determination. If the determination shall not be made on or before June 1, the effective date of the average weekly wage when determined shall be the first day of the month next following 30 days after the determination is made.
(c) The maximum and minimum weekly benefit shall not be changed on any July 1 or as a result of any annual determination, unless the computation provided for in subsection (b) of this section results in an increase or decrease of two dollars ($2) or more in the amount of either the maximum or minimum benefit.
(d) In no event, except as provided for permanent total disability in subdivision (a)(4) of Section 25-5-57 or except for compensation benefits payable for permanent partial and temporary total disability in connection with a disability scheduled in subdivisions (1) and (3) of subsection (a) of Section 25-5-57, shall the total amount of compensation payable for an accident or an occupational disease exceed the product of 500 times the maximum weekly benefit applicable on the date of the accident.
(e) The minimum and maximum benefits that are in effect on the date of the accident which results in injury or death shall be applicable for the full period during which compensation is payable.

 Section 25-5-77 
Section 25-5-77 Expenses of medical and surgical treatment, vocational rehabilitation, medicine, etc.; medical examinations; review by ombudsman of medical services.
(a) In addition to the compensation provided in this article and Article 4 of this chapter, the employer, where applicable, shall pay the actual cost of the repair, refitting, or replacement of artificial members damaged as the result of an accident arising out of and in the course of employment, and the employer, except as otherwise provided in this amendatory act, shall pay an amount not to exceed the prevailing rate or maximum schedule of fees as established herein of reasonably necessary medical and surgical treatment and attention, physical rehabilitation, medicine, medical and surgical supplies, crutches, artificial members, and other apparatus as the result of an accident arising out of and in the course of the employment, as may be obtained by the injured employee or, in case of death, obtained during the period occurring between the time of the injury and the employee's death therefrom. If the employee is dissatisfied with the initial treating physician selected by the employer and if further treatment is required, the employee may so advise the employer, and the employee shall be entitled to select a second physician from a panel or list of four physicians selected by the employer. If surgery is required and if the employee is dissatisfied with the designated surgeon, he or she may so advise the employer, and the employee shall be entitled to select a second surgeon from a panel or list of four surgeons selected by the employer. If four physicians or surgeons are not available to be listed, the employer shall include on the list as many as are available. The four physicians or surgeons selected by the employer hereunder shall not be from or members of the same firm, partnership, or professional corporation. The total liability of the employer shall, unless otherwise provided in this chapter, not exceed the prevailing rate or the maximum schedule of fees as established herein. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in ascertaining the prevailing rate of reimbursement or payment with regard to participating hospitals and ambulatory surgical centers or outpatient rehabilitation centers licensed by the State of Alabama, as well as diagnostic facilities accredited by the Commission on Accreditation of Rehabilitation Facilities, the prevailing rate shall be negotiated with each individual hospital, ambulatory surgical center, licensed outpatient rehabilitation facility, or diagnostic facility based on that institution's treatment of comparable type cases for the 12-month period immediately preceding August 1, 1992. These rates shall be updated every 12 months thereafter. Initial rates shall be established within six months of August 1, 1992. For those non-participating hospitals the prevailing rate shall be determined by a committee. In the first year following August 1, 1992, the committee shall be composed of five members. The director shall appoint one member from the Department of Industrial Relations and two members from the community in which the non-participating hospital is located. The non-participating hospital shall appoint two members. This committee shall by a majority vote establish the maximum rates of reimbursement or payment for the non-participating hospital, and the hospital shall be bound for one year by the determined rates of reimbursement or payment for workers' compensation cases. If, following the first year after the rates were established by this committee, the hospital is again non-participating, then another committee shall be appointed. This second committee shall have three members selected by the non-participating hospital and two members selected by the director. The committee composition shall alternate as above described each year the hospital is non-participating. The total liability of the employer shall not exceed the rates established by the committee. This committee, in determining the rates of reimbursement or payments to the hospital, may consider such factors as the size, staffing, and medical equipment of the hospital, and any other factors which the committee may consider relevant. If an insurer of the employee or a benefit association has paid or is liable for the employee's medical, surgical, and hospital service or for a part thereof, or if the employee is entitled to the same or a part thereof, from any source whatever by virtue of any agreement or understanding or law, state or federal, without any loss of benefit to the employee, the employer shall not be required to pay any part of the expense. If the benefits are insufficient to pay all the employee's expense, the employer shall be liable for the deficiency only. All cases of dispute as to the necessity and value of the services shall be determined by the tribunal having jurisdiction of the claim of the injured employee for compensation.
(b) If requested to do so by the employer, the injured employee shall submit to examination by the employer's physician at all reasonable times, but the employee shall have the right to have a physician of his or her own selection present at the examination, in which case the employee shall be liable to the physician of his or her own selection for his or her services. The employer shall pay for the services of the physician making the examination at the instance of the employer. If a dispute arises as to the injury, or as to the extent of the disability therefrom, the court may, at the instance of either party or of its own motion, appoint a neutral physician of good standing and ability to make an examination of the injured employee and to report his or her findings to the court, the expense of which examination shall be borne equally by the parties. If the injured employee refuses to comply with reasonable request for examination, or refuses to accept the medical service or physical rehabilitation, which the employer elects to furnish under this chapter, the employee's right to compensation shall be suspended and no compensation shall be payable for the period of the refusal. A physician whose services are furnished or paid for by the employer, or a physician of the injured employee who treats or makes or is present at any examination of an injured employee may be required to testify as to any knowledge obtained by him or her in the course of the treatment or examination as the treatment or examination related to the injury or the disability arising therefrom. The physician shall, upon written request of the injured employee or his or her employer and without consent of or notice to the employee or employer not making the request, furnish the injured employee or his or her employer a written statement of his or her professional opinion as to the extent of the injury and disability. In all death claims where the cause of death is obscure or is disputed, any interested party may require an autopsy, the cost of which is to be borne by the party demanding the autopsy. The term "physicians" shall include medical doctor, surgeon, and chiropractor. A hospital, medical clinic, rehabilitation service, or other person or entity providing treatment to an employee or providing facilities at which the employee receives treatment shall, upon the written request of the employee or of the employer, furnish, at a reasonable cost, the employee or the employer a copy of the records, including X-rays and laboratory reports, relating to the treatment of the injured employee. The copy may be furnished without the consent of or notice to the employee or employer not making the request. A physician, hospital, medical clinic, rehabilitation service, or other person or entity providing written statement of professional opinion or copies of records pursuant to this subsection shall not be liable to any person for a claim arising out of the release of medical information concerning the employee.
(c) If the employer so elects, the employee shall submit to and undergo vocational rehabilitation at the employer's expense through a vocational rehabilitation specialist, who shall be qualified to render competent vocational rehabilitation service. If an employee who is unable in the opinion of the treating physician to return to his or her former employment shall request vocational rehabilitation and if both a vocational rehabilitation specialist and a treating physician, the cost of whose service is the obligation of the employer under this section, shall express their opinions in writing that in the judgment of each of them vocational rehabilitation is reasonably calculated to restore the employee to gainful employment and is in the best interest of the employee, the cost of the rehabilitation shall be borne by the employer. The cost, where rehabilitation requires residence at or near a facility or institution away from the employee's customary residence, shall include reasonable charges for the employee's necessary board, lodging, and travel.
(d) If an employee refuses, without the consent of the court, to accept vocational rehabilitation at the employer's request, the refusal shall result in loss of compensation for the period of refusal.
(e) All disputes with regard to vocational rehabilitation may be submitted to the court for resolution.
(f) The employer shall pay mileage costs to and from medical and rehabilitation providers at the same rate as provided by law for official state travel.
(g) In a compensable workers' compensation claim, the injured employee shall not be liable for payment of any authorized and compensable medical expenses associated with the workers' compensation claim.
(h) All undisputed medical reimbursements or payments shall be made within 25 working days of receipt of claims in the form specified in Section 25-5-3. There shall be added to any undisputed medical invoice which is not paid within 25 working days an amount equal to 10 percent of the unpaid balance.
If the employer or insurer responsible for payment of the claim fails to add the additional 10 percent to the claim as required by this section, the person, firm, corporation, or partnership providing the medical service for which payment has been delayed beyond the period specified in this section may file a written complaint stating that fact with the director. Upon investigation, if the director determines that the facts stated in the complaint are true, then in that event the director shall order the employer or insurer to pay to the provider the amount of the claim and any applicable penalty, and in addition may assess a civil monetary penalty in amount not to exceed $500 against the employer or insurer, payment of which shall be made to the director within 30 days of the notice of assessment.
(i) Any party, including a health care provider, is entitled to a review by an ombudsman of medical services that are provided or for which authorization of payment is sought if any party or the health care provider has any of the following:
(1) Been denied payment or had the charge reduced for medical services rendered.
(2) Been denied authorization for the payment of services requested or performed when authorization is required.
(3) Been ordered by the director to refund payments received for the provision of medical services.
(4) A party to a medical dispute that remains unresolved after a review of medical services as provided by this section may petition the court for relief.
(5) In any review under this subsection of medical services provided by a physician, any party to a dispute may request that the ombudsman consult with an independent medical expert for the purpose of obtaining advice and consultation on the resolution of any issue involving medical practice. If such a request is made, the ombudsman shall select an independent medical expert from among a list of at least three names provided by the Workers' Compensation Medical Services Board in a medical specialty appropriate to the issues raised in the dispute and shall secure a written opinion from the independent medical expert. In rendering a decision or recommendation, the ombudsman shall give full consideration to the opinion of the independent medical expert but shall not be bound by that opinion. The independent medical expert shall be compensated at a rate set by the Workers' Compensation Medical Services Board and approved by the director.

For purposes of this article only, an injured employee or the employee's representative, within five days after the occurrence of an accident, shall give or cause to be given to the employer written notice of the accident. If the notice is not given, the employee or the employee's dependent shall not be entitled to physician's or medical fees nor any compensation which may have accrued under the terms of this article, unless it can be shown that the party required to give the notice had been prevented from doing so by reason of physical or mental incapacity, other than minority, fraud or deceit, or equal good reason.

 Section 25-5-80 
Section 25-5-80 Limitation period for claims or actions for compensation.
In case of a personal injury not involving cumulative physical stress, all claims for compensation under this article shall be forever barred unless within two years after the accident the parties shall have agreed upon the compensation payable under this article or unless within two years after the accident one of the parties shall have filed a verified complaint as provided in Section 25-5-88. In cases involving personal injury due to cumulative physical stress, compensation under this article shall be forever barred unless within two years after the date of the injury one of the parties shall have filed a verified complaint as provided in Section 25-5-88.

===================================================================

 
 Section 25-5-81 
Section 25-5-81 Determination of disputed compensation claims generally. 
(a) Commencement of action in circuit court. 
(1) PROCEDURE. In case of a dispute between employer and employee or between the dependents of a deceased employee and the employer with respect to the right to compensation under this article and Article 2 of this chapter, or the amount thereof, either party may submit the controversy to the circuit court of the county which would have jurisdiction of a civil action in tort between the parties. The controversy shall be heard and determined by the judge who would hear and determine a civil action between the same parties arising out of tort, and, in case there is more than one judge of the court, the controversies shall be set and assigned for hearing under the same rules and statutes that civil actions in tort are set and assigned. The court may hear and determine the controversies in a summary manner. The decision of the judge hearing the same shall be conclusive and binding between the parties, subject to the right of appeal provided for in this article. 
(2) RIGHT TO JURY TRIAL. When willful misconduct on the part of the employee is set up by the employer, as it is provided for in this article, the employer may, upon appearing, demand a jury to hear and determine, under the direction of the court, the issues involved in this defense. If the employer fails to demand a jury upon appearing, the employee may demand a jury to try the issues by filing a demand within five days after the appearance of the employer. When a jury is demanded by either party, the court shall submit the issues of fact as to willful misconduct set up by the employer to the jury, for a special finding of the facts subject to the usual powers of the court over verdicts rendered contrary to the evidence or the law, but the judge shall determine all other questions involved in the controversy without a jury. Upon setting up the defense, the employer shall serve a copy of the answer, setting up the defense, upon the employee or the attorney of record. 
(b) Court deemed open at all times. For the purpose of hearing and determining controversies between an employer and employee or the dependents of a deceased employee and the employer arising under this article and Article 2 of this chapter, the circuit court shall be deemed always in session. 
(c) Evidence. The decision of the court shall be based on a preponderance of the evidence as contained in the record of the hearing, except in cases involving injuries which have resulted from gradual deterioration or cumulative physical stress disorders, which shall be deemed compensable only upon a finding of clear and convincing proof that those injuries arose out of and in the course of the employee's employment. 
For the purposes of this amendatory act, "clear and convincing" shall mean evidence that, when weighted against evidence in opposition, will produce in the mind of the trier of fact a firm conviction as to each essential element of the claim and a high probability as to the correctness of the conclusion. Proof by clear and convincing evidence requires a level of proof greater than a preponderance of the evidence or the substantial weight of the evidence, but less than beyond a reasonable doubt. 
(d) Interpleader of adverse claimants to compensation. If at any time there are adverse claimants to compensation under this article, the employer, in submitting the claim to the circuit court, may suggest in writing the claimants, and they shall be required to interplead. The court shall determine and order to which claimant or claimants compensation is justly due, and the employer, upon complying with the order of the judge, shall be released from the claims of any other claimants thereto. 
(e) Review. From an order or judgment, any aggrieved party may, within 42 days thereafter, appeal to the Court of Civil Appeals and review shall be as in cases reviewed as follows: 
(1) In reviewing the standard of proof set forth herein and other legal issues, review by the Court of Civil Appeals shall be without a presumption of correctness. 
(2) In reviewing pure findings of fact, the finding of the circuit court shall not be reversed if that finding is supported by substantial evidence.
(f) Discovery. Methods of discovery shall be determined and established in rules promulgated by this amendatory act and the rules established by the Alabama Rules of Civil Procedure with the limitations of pre-trial discovery as set forth below. Additionally, the following rules of discovery shall apply to workers' compensation cases:
(1) Two depositions for each side shall be permitted without leave of court, however, any additional depositions shall not be permitted except with leave of court for good cause shown including, but not limited to, a claim by the employee for permanent total disability. 
(2) Notwithstanding the limitations in (1) above, each party may take the deposition of every other party. 
(3) No more than 25 interrogatory questions with each sub-part to be considered a question shall be permitted without leave of court for good cause shown.
(4) Certified sealed copies of records of medical treatment and charges therefor, whether from a physician, hospital, clinic, or other provider, shall be authenticated in accordance with Alabama Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 44(h), without further need for authenticating testimony. Copies of records obtained by one party shall be furnished by certified mail to the other party not less than 21 days prior to trial, unless the party offering the records can establish unusual circumstances justifying their admission despite the failure to make the exchange after receiving the records of a physician's treatment prior to trial, the party not offering the records of a physician's treatment shall, without regard to the limitation set forth herein, have the right to depose prior to trial the physician whose records of treatment are to be offered by any other party.
It is the intent of this section that limited discovery shall be available.

Section 25-5-82 Compensation for death to be paid only to United States residents.
Compensation for the death of an employee shall be paid only to dependents who, at the time of the death of the injured employee, were actually residents of the United States.

 Section 25-5-83 
Section 25-5-83 Commutation of compensation to lump sum payments.
By agreement of the parties and with approval of the court, the amounts of compensation payable periodically, under this article and Article 4 of this chapter, may be commuted to one or more lump sum payments. No commutation shall be approved by the court unless the court is satisfied that it is in the best interest of the employee or the employee's dependent, in case of death, to receive the compensation in a lump sum rather than in periodic payments. In making the commutations, the lump sum payment shall, in the aggregate, amount to a sum equal to the present value of all future installments of compensation calculated on a six percent basis.

Section 25-5-85 Procedure for and effect of payment of compensation to court appointed trustee.
At any time after the amount of an award has been agreed upon by the parties or found and ordered by the court, a sum equal to the present value of all future installments of compensation calculated on a six percent basis may, where death or the nature of the injury renders the amount of future payments certain, by leave of court, be paid by the employer to a bank or trust company of this state or a national bank doing business in this state to be approved and designated by the court, and the sum, together with all interest thereon, shall thereafter be held in trust for the employee or dependent of the employee, who shall have no further recourse against the employer. The payment of the sum by the employer, evidenced by the receipts in duplicate of the trustees, one of which shall be filed with the probate judge of the county in which the injury or death occurred and the other filed with the court, shall operate as a satisfaction of the award as to the employer, and the trustee designated by the court shall be allowed to pay itself from the fund a reasonable compensation for acting as the trustee, which compensation shall be fixed by the court in the order making the designation. Payments from the fund shall be made by the trustee in the same amounts and at the same time as are required in this article of the employer until the fund, after deducting the trustee's compensation as above provided, and interest shall be exhausted. In the appointment of the trustee, preference shall be given, in the discretion of the court, to the choice of the injured employee or the dependent of the deceased employee. If the right to receive compensation should terminate on account of death, becoming of age, or marriage, or for any other cause as provided in this article, the balance remaining in the bank or trust company after the termination should be returned by them to the employer, his or her successor, or assigns.

Either party to a controversy arising under this article and Article 2 of this chapter may file a verified complaint in the circuit court of the county which would have jurisdiction of an action between the same parties arising out of tort, which shall set forth the names and residences of the parties and the circumstances relating to the employment at the time of the injury, with a full description of the injury, its nature and extent, the amount of the average earnings received by the employee which would affect his compensation under this article and Article 2 of this chapter, the knowledge of the employer of the injury or the notice to him thereof, which must be of the kind provided for in this article and Article 2 of this chapter and such other facts as may be necessary to enable the court to determine what, if any, compensation the employee or, in case of a deceased employee, his dependents, are entitled to under this article and Article 2 of this chapter. The complaint shall be filed with the clerk of the circuit court, who shall cause summons to be issued thereon requiring the defendant to come in and answer said complaint within 30 days of the service thereof. Thereafter, said action shall proceed in accordance with and shall be governed by the same rules and statutes as govern civil actions, except as otherwise provided in this article and Article 2 of this chapter, and except that all civil actions filed hereunder shall be preferred actions and shall be set down and tried as expeditiously as possible. At the hearing or any adjournment thereof the court shall hear such witnesses as may be presented by each party, and in a summary manner without a jury, unless one is demanded to try the issue of willful misconduct on the part of the employee, shall decide the controversy. This determination shall be filed in writing with the clerk of said court, and judgment shall be entered thereon in the same manner as in civil actions tried in the said circuit court and shall contain a statement of the law and facts and conclusions as determined by said judge. Subsequent proceedings thereon shall only be for the recovery of moneys thereby determined to be due, but nothing in this section contained shall be construed as limiting the jurisdiction of the Court of Civil Appeals to review questions of law by certiorari.

 Section 25-5-110  Section 25-5-110 Definitions. For the purposes of this article, the following terms shall have the meanings respectively ascribed to them by this section: (1) OCCUPATIONAL DISEASE. A disease arising out of and in the course of employment, including occupational pneumoconiosis and occupational exposure to radiation as defined in subdivisions (2) and (3), respectively, of this section, which is due to hazards in excess of those ordinarily incident to employment in general and is peculiar to the occupation in which the employee is engaged but without regard to negligence or fault, if any, of the employer. A disease, including, but not limited to, loss of hearing due to noise, shall be deemed an occupational disease only if caused by a hazard recognized as peculiar to a particular trade, process, occupation, or employment as a direct result of exposure, over a period of time, to the normal working conditions of the trade, process, occupation, or employment. (2) OCCUPATIONAL PNEUMOCONIOSIS. A disease of the lungs caused by inhalation of minute particles of dust over a period of time, which dust is due to causes and conditions arising out of and in the course of the employment, without regard to whether the causes or conditions are inherent in the employment or can be eliminated or reduced by due care on the part of the employer. The term "occupational pneumoconiosis" shall include, but without limitation, such diseases as silicosis, siderosis, anthracosis, anthrasilicosis, anthracosilicosis, anthraco-tuberculosis, tuberculosilicosis, silico-tuberculosis, aluminosis, and other diseases of the lungs resulting from causes enumerated in this section. (3) OCCUPATIONAL EXPOSURE TO RADIATION. Gradual exposure to radiation over a period of time from the use of or direct contact with radium, radioactive substances, roentgen rays (X-rays), or ionizing radiation, arising out of and in the course of the employment and resulting from the nature of the employment in which the employee is engaged, without regard to whether the exposure is inherent in the employment or can be eliminated or reduced by due care on the part of the employer. (4) NATURE OF EMPLOYMENT. With respect to subdivisions (2) and (3) above, this term shall mean that, as to the industry in which the employee is engaged, there is attached a particular hazard of the exposure that distinguishes it from the usual run of occupations and is in excess of the hazards of the exposure attending employment in general. (5) CONTRACTION OF AN OCCUPATIONAL DISEASE. This term shall include any aggravation of the disease without regard to the employment in which the disease was contracted.

For the purposes of this article, the following terms shall have the meanings respectively ascribed to them by this section:
(1) OCCUPATIONAL EXPOSURE TO RADIATION. Gradual exposure to radiation over a period of time from the use of or direct contact with radium, radioactive substances, roentgen rays (X rays) or ionizing radiation, arising out of and in the course of the employment and resulting from the nature of the employment in which the employee is engaged, without regard to whether or not said exposure is inherent in the employment or can be eliminated or reduced by due care on the part of the employer. The term "occupational exposure to radiation" shall not include accidents involving sudden and violent injuries within the meaning of subdivision (9) of Section 25-5-1, such accidents being covered by such section.
(2) NATURE OF EMPLOYMENT. Such term shall mean that, as to the industry in which the employee is engaged, there is attached a particular hazard of such exposure that distinguishes it from the usual run of occupations and is in excess of the hazards of such exposure attending employment in general.

No agreement, express or implied, to shorten or to extend said limitations shall be valid or binding on either of the parties when said employment, at the time of said exposure, is or was subject to the provisions of this article. The "date of the injury" shall mean, for all purposes of this article, the date of the last exposure to the hazards of radiation in the employment of the employer in whose employment the employee was last exposed, within a period of five years prior to the date of the injury, to the hazards of radiation in each of at least 12 months.

===================================================================

 
 Section 25-5-293 
Section 25-5-293 Duties of director; continuing education, accounting; recovery of expenses; advisory committees; legislative intent regarding reimbursements.
(a) The Director of the Department of Industrial Relations may prescribe rules and regulations for the purpose of conducting continuing education seminars for all personnel associated with workers' compensation claims and collect registration fees in order to cover the related expenditures. The director may adopt rules and regulations setting continuing education standards for workers' compensation claims personnel employed by insurance companies and self-insured employers and groups.
(b) The director shall file annually with the Governor and the presiding officer of each house of the Legislature a complete and detailed written report accounting for all funds received and disbursed during the preceding fiscal year. The annual report shall be in the form and reported in the time provided by law.
(c) The director shall establish reasonable charges to recover expenses for services not required by law or rule provided to persons requesting the services from the Department of Industrial Relations.
(d) The director shall appoint appropriate advisory committees on workers' compensation matters, including: an advisory committee consisting of three administrators who are members of the Alabama Hospital Association, who shall be selected by the director from nominations submitted by the Alabama Hospital Association; an advisory committee consisting of three chiropractors who are members in good standing with the Alabama State Chiropractic Association, who shall be selected by the director from nominations submitted by the Alabama State Chiropractic Association; an advisory committee consisting of three pharmacists who are members in good standing with the Alabama Pharmaceutical Association who shall be selected by the director from nominations submitted by the Alabama Pharmaceutical Association; and an advisory committee consisting of three optometrists who are members in good standing with the Alabama Optometric Association who shall be selected by the director from nominations submitted by the Alabama Optometric Association. These committees shall guide the director and make recommendations to ascertain the prevailing rate of reimbursement or payment of medical costs in the State of Alabama. These committees shall make recommendations with regard to the implementation of all other rules and regulations, including, but not limited to, utilization review by like peers. These committees shall also advise and guide the director in determining all other rules and regulations required to accomplish the intent of the Legislature in assuring the quality of medical care and achieving medical cost control.
The director shall also appoint a vocational rehabilitation advisory committee consisting of at least five professional licensed rehabilitation specialists. These rehabilitation specialists shall be selected by the director from nominations from the rehabilitation associations in the State of Alabama, including, but not limited to, the Alabama Physical Therapy Association. The committee shall guide the director and make recommendations to ascertain the prevailing rate of reimbursement or payment of rehabilitation costs in the State of Alabama. The committee shall also make recommendations with regard to the implementation of all other rules and regulations, including but not limited to, utilization review, and with regard to rehabilitation policies as provided by this article. The committee shall also advise and guide the director in determining all other rules and regulations required to accomplish the intent of the Legislature in assuring the quality of rehabilitation care and achieving rehabilitation cost control.
(e) The director shall appoint an advisory committee consisting of attorneys who are members in good standing of the Alabama State Bar. This committee shall guide and assist the director in creating and promulgating rules and regulations for the efficient administration of the Ombudsman Program.
Members of the advisory committee shall receive State of Alabama mileage expense which shall be paid by the Department of Industrial Relations.
(f) It is the intent of the Legislature that final reimbursements related to workers' compensation claims be commensurate and in line with the prevailing rate of reimbursement or payment in the State of Alabama, or as otherwise provided in this article. The director shall conduct field audits as necessary to assist the private sector to gain compliance with the legislative intent. The department shall develop administrative rules to facilitate implementation and continuity of the legislative intent of this article. The director, except as otherwise provided in this article, shall not establish the prevailing rate of payment or reimbursement, but may collect data which are construed to be statistically significant as defined by an independent, disinterested consultant. By definition, the prevailing rate of payment or reimbursement is self-defining and self-setting and shall be updated annually. The director may create a statistically valid data base from which prevailing rates of reimbursement or payment shall be ascertained. Except as otherwise provided herein, the prevailing rate of reimbursement or payment for medical services provided under this article shall be effective 30 days after the prevailing rate of reimbursement or payment is discovered, but in no event earlier than six months from May 19, 1992.
(g) Insurance carriers and self-insurers, individual and group, are required to make appropriate payment for services provided under this article. Unless otherwise provided in this article, an insurance carrier or self-insurer, individual or group, shall not pay more than the applicable prevailing rate of reimbursement for medical services. Insurance carriers and self-insurers, individual and group, may have utilization review and medical bill screenings. Utilization review and bill screening shall be performed by qualified individuals or entities to insure the integrity of the services and the quality of cost containment. It is the express legislative intent of this article to ensure that the highest quality health care is available to employees who become injured or ill as the result of employment, at an appropriate rate of provider reimbursement. All insurers, claims adjusters, self-administered employers, and any entity involved in the administration or payment of workers' compensation claims may, but are not required to, implement utilization review and bill screening for health services provided to employees covered under this article. In this regard, employers' liability for reimbursement shall be limited to the prevailing rate or maximum fee schedule established by the Workers' Compensation Services Board for similar treatment. Services provided that are deemed not medically necessary are not reimbursable and the employer is held harmless. In no event is the employee responsible or held liable for any charges associated with an authorized workers' compensation claim. To ensure compliance of providers, insurance carriers, and self-insurers, the director may provide by rule for the review and audit of insurance carriers and self-insurers, individual and group, of payments for medical services. The director may maintain a statewide data base from insurance carriers and self-insurers, individual and group, on medical charges, actual payments, and adjudication methods for use in administering this article.
(h) Claims payors, and insurers operating in Alabama shall, at the director's request, provide the director such data as he or she deems necessary to evaluate costs and quality. The data shall be provided in the form and content to the director's specifications and in a manner deemed timely by the director. The director may gather from health care claims intermediaries that operate in Alabama any claims data related to diagnoses and procedures encountered in the treatment of workers'-compensation-type injury and illness in Alabama. Results from all data gathered shall be made available to employers or their representatives for use in decisions regarding the direction of care or to determine appropriateness of reimbursement.
(i) Beginning immediately after May 19, 1992, and to be completed within six months thereafter, the director may engage an independent firm to identify the initial costs for the program. These initial expenses shall include, but not be limited to, the establishment of a data base to determine prevailing rates, and the conducting of cost analysis for appropriate reimbursement rates to hospitals and other facilities.
(j) A person who performs services for the director pertaining to the policies of any advisory committee or board is immune from civil liability against any claim arising out of, or related to, any decision made in good faith, and without malice, and predicated upon information which was then available to the person. Immunity from liability under this section does not apply to a person providing medical treatment to an injured employee.
(k) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section to the contrary, it is the intent of this section that any and all utilization review, bill screening, medical necessity determinations, or audits which relate to the services of physicians as defined in Section 25-5-310 shall only be conducted under and in accordance with policies, guidelines, or regulations which have been jointly approved by the Workers' Compensation Medical Services Board and the director under the provisions of Section 25-5-312, as and when such policies, guidelines, criteria, and regulations are adopted in a final and effective form pursuant to the Alabama Administrative Procedure Act. Not later than six months from May 19, 1992, the director, with the approval of the board, shall publish a notice of the intended action in Alabama Administrative Monthly to adopt initial policies, guidelines, criteria, or regulations for utilization review, medical necessity determinations, and bill screenings; however, each insurer, self-insured employer, claims administrator, or other payor may continue utilization review, medical necessity determinations, and bill screenings unaffected by this article during the first six months from May 19, 1992, or until such policies, guidelines, criteria, or regulations may become effective in a final adopted form within that initial six month period. If such above referenced pending policies, guidelines, criteria, or regulations have not become effective in a final form pursuant to the Administrative Procedure Act after six months from May 19, 1992, then until such time as they are finally adopted, each insurer, self-insured employer, or claims administrator shall conduct utilization review, medical necessity determinations, and bill screenings in a manner that is consistent with similar practices of a majority of commercial insurance companies authorized to issue policies of health insurance in this state. Any amendments, including additions or deletions, to the initial policies, guidelines, criteria, or regulations shall be adopted in accordance with the requirements of this section and Section 25-5-312.

===================================================================

 
 Section 25-5-313 
Section 25-5-313 Schedule of maximum fees.
Within 60 days from May 19, 1992, the Workers' Compensation Medical Services Board shall submit to the Governor an initial schedule of maximum fees for medical services covered by this article, which schedule shall become effective immediately upon submission to the Governor. The initial schedule of maximum fees shall be established by the board in the manner prescribed in this section. The fee for each service in the schedule shall be exactly equal to an amount derived by multiplying the preferred provider reimbursement customarily paid on May 19, 1992, by the largest health care service plan incorporated pursuant to Sections 10-4-100 to 10-4-115, inclusive, by a factor of 1.075, which product shall be the maximum fee for each such service. In addition the board may submit to the Governor for approval on or before January 31, 1993, a revised schedule of selected fees for medical services covered by this article, which fees shall not exceed the fees established in the initial schedule of fees by more than 2 1/2 percent. The revised schedule of fees, but not individual fees or separate portions thereof, shall be subject to acceptance or rejection by the Governor. If the revised schedule of fees is rejected by the Governor, it shall be referred to the board for further consideration and the initial schedule of maximum fees shall continue to be in effect until the Governor and the board reach agreement; provided, however, the schedule of maximum fees in effect on January 31, 1993, shall not be subject to further revision through this process.
The schedule of maximum fees and any additions, deletions, corrections, or changes thereto shall not be considered a rule or regulation requiring publication under the Alabama Administrative Procedure Act. It is the express legislative intent that the Workers' Compensation Medical Services Board may establish a system of maximum fees under this section for services rendered by physicians to employees covered by the Workers' Compensation Law and that the schedule of fees shall replace and supplant traditional competitive market mechanisms in the interest of obtaining quality physician services in a cost effective manner. The board shall annually adjust the schedule of fees established pursuant to this section by increases which shall be no more than the annual increase in the cost of living as reflected by the U. S. Department of Labor consumer price index. The board may, from time to time, add to or adjust the schedule of fees in response to changes in technology and medical practice, subject only to the right of the Governor to accept or reject the addition or adjustment made by the board, and to refer to the board for further consideration any additions or adjustments which he or she may reject. In the event that at any time a state or federal tax, levy, fee, or assessment is imposed or assessed on physicians licensed to practice medicine which tax, levy, fee, or assessment is based in whole or in part upon the provision of professional services in connection with the practice of medicine, then, in that event, the board may, subject to the approval of the Governor, within three months of the effective date of the tax, levy, fee, or assessment issue a revised schedule of maximum fees which increases the maximum fee for each service reflected therein by an amount which shall be no more than the rate fixed by law of the tax, levy, fee, or assessment. This provision shall not be construed to include income or sales tax increases. The liability of the employer for the payment of services rendered by physicians shall not exceed those maximum fees established by the board and approved by the Governor. The employees shall not be liable to the physician for any amount in excess of the schedule of maximum fees established by the board and approved by the Governor.

===================================================================

 
Section 25-5-316 Workers' Compensation Administrative Trust Fund; creation; management; trustee and custodian; assessments; penalties. (a) There is established in the State Treasury a fund entitled the Workers' Compensation Administrative Trust Fund, into which shall be deposited certain assessments provided under Chapter 5 (commencing with Section 25-5-1) of Title 25 collected by the Department of Industrial Relations. The fund shall constitute a separate fund to be disbursed by the State Comptroller on order of the Director of the Department of Industrial Relations. All expenses incurred by the department under the Workers' Compensation Law, including the salaries of all employees, travel cost, and any other cost of administration and enforcement as may become necessary, either within or without the state, shall be paid from the separate fund in the State Treasury upon warrants of the State Comptroller drawn upon the State Treasury from time to time when vouchers therefor are approved by the director. The State Treasurer shall pay moneys from the separate fund upon the order of the director. The total expense for every purpose incurred shall not exceed the total assessment collected and paid into the fund. The total expense for every purpose incurred in implementing this article shall not exceed the amount appropriated by the Legislature in the general fund appropriation act. No funds shall be withdrawn or expended except those budgeted and allocated in accordance with Article 4 (commencing with Section 41-4-80) of Chapter 4 of Title 41. All moneys remaining unexpended in the separate fund at the end of the fiscal year shall remain in the State Treasury to be expended as herein provided. Included in the budget shall be an amount of money allocated for the specific and exclusive purpose of paying only benefits to the claimants who have qualified to receive benefits from the second injury trust fund on May 19, 1992. Payments of these benefits shall be made weekly. The director shall each week make requisitions to the State Comptroller who shall draw warrants on the State Treasurer for the weekly compensation amount. The warrants shall be drawn only if there are sufficient moneys in the treasury for immediate payment. Claims shall take priority in an ascending numerical order according to the time of the accident, and the time shown in the settlement between the employer and employee shall be prima facie evidence of the time of the accident. No funds allocated for the payment of benefits from the fund shall be used to pay lump-sum attorney's fees. Payment shall resume at the end of the first week of the fiscal year in which the Legislature approves the requested budget for the Workers' Compensation Administrative Trust Fund. The claimants who were receiving weekly benefits from the second injury trust fund as of August 31, 1991, shall be paid all weekly benefits due to date and the benefits shall be continued for the duration of claim. Those amounts shall be paid from the moneys as allocated. (b) The State Treasurer shall determine if the money in the trust fund shall be kept in cash or invested. The moneys in the fund may be invested by the State Treasurer and all moneys and interest remaining unexpended in the separate fund provided at the end of the fiscal year shall remain in the State Treasury to be expended as herein provided. (c) The director is designated as trustee of the fund and the State Treasurer is designated as custodian of the fund, and both shall furnish bonds in amounts deemed appropriate. The cost of bonds for the trustee, custodian, and other employees or officials required to post bond in connection with the program shall be paid out of the fund. (d) Each insurance carrier, self-insured employer, and group fund shall be assessed $250.00. The gross claims for compensation and medical payments paid by the carriers, self-insured employers, and group funds are the basis for computing the amount to be assessed. The amount of assessment shall be based upon the proportion that the total gross claims for compensation and medical payments paid by the carrier, self-insured employer, or group fund during the preceding calendar year bore to the total gross claims for compensation and medical payments paid by all carriers, self-insured employers, and group funds during that period. The total assessment shall not exceed $5,000,000.00 per year. The director shall determine if the assessment shall be a specific amount or shall be a percentage of gross claims for compensation and medical payments paid by the insurance carriers, self-insured employers, and group funds. An assessment shall not exceed an amount reasonably necessary to defray the necessary administration expense. (e) The department shall provide by regulation for the collection of the amounts assessed against each insurance carrier, self-insured employer, and group fund. The amounts shall be paid within 30 days from the date that the notice is served upon the insurance carrier, self-insured employer, and group fund. If the amounts are not paid within that period, there may be assessed, for each 30 days that the amount so assessed remains unpaid, a civil penalty equal to 10 percent of the amount unpaid. The amount of the civil penalty shall be collected at the same time the amount assessed is collected. (f) If an insurance carrier, self-insured employer, or group fund fails to pay the amounts assessed against it within 60 days from the time the notice is served, the department may suspend or revoke the authorization to the self-insurer and may request that the Department of Insurance revoke the authority of the insurance company to insure workers' compensation. (g) The department may require from each insurance carrier, self-insured employer, and group fund reports with respect to all payments of compensation and medical payments by the insurance carriers, self-insured employers, or group funds during each calendar year, and may determine the amounts paid by each insurance carrier, self-insured employer, and group fund and may determine the amounts paid by all insurance carriers, self-insured employers, and group funds during the period. (h) On or before the first day of March of each year, every insurance carrier, self-insured employer, and group fund shall file with the department a statement on the prescribed forms showing the gross claims for compensation and medical payments paid by the insurance carrier, self-insured employer, or group fund during the preceding one-year period ending on the 31st day of December. Any insurance carrier, self-insured employer, or group fund which neglects to file its annual written statement within the time provided in this manner shall pay to the Workers' Compensation Administrative Trust Fund a penalty for each day's neglect in an amount prescribed by rule of the director. (i) All money collected under this section shall be deposited in the Workers' Compensation Administrative Trust Fund. (Acts 1992, No. 92-537, p. 1082, &sect;48.)

(b) For each policy of workers' compensation insurance issued or renewed in the state on and after July 1, 1996, there shall be granted by the insurer a five percent reduction in the premium for the policy if the insured has been certified by the Department of Industrial Relations, Workers' Compensation Division, as having a drug-free workplace program which complies with the requirements of this article and has notified its insurer in writing of the certification. 
(c)(1) The premium discount provided by this section shall be applied to an insured's policy of workers' compensation insurance pro rata as of the date the insured receives certification by the Department of Industrial Relations, Workers' Compensation Division, and shall continue for a period not to exceed four years. Notwithstanding the foregoing, an insurer shall not be required to credit the actual amount of the premium discount to the account of the insured until the final premium audit under the policy. Certification of an insured shall be required for each of the four years in which the premium discount is granted. Thereafter, any premium discount pursuant to this article shall be determined from the experience rating plan of the insured, or in the case of an insured not rated upon experience, as provided in subdivision (2).

(f) The State Insurance Commissioner may promulgate rules and regulations necessary for the implementation and enforcement of this article.

Section 25-14-2 Legislative findings.
The Legislature finds and declares the following:

(2) The Legislature deems it necessary, however, in the interest of the welfare of workers and employers to establish standards for the operation, regulation, and registration of professional employer organizations in Alabama to be administered by the Workers' Compensation Division of the Department of Industrial Relations, and it is the intent of the Legislature that this be accomplished pursuant to the Alabama Professional Employer Organization Registration Act.
(3) That any allocation of the employer duties and responsibilities pursuant to this chapter will preserve all rights to which covered employees would be entitled under a traditional employment relationship.

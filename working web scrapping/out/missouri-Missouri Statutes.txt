 287.010. This chapter shall be known as "The Workers'
Compensation Law".
    (RSMo 1939 Â§ 3689, A.L. 1980 H.B. 1396)
    Prior revision: 1929 Â§ 3299

    (1960) Defenses that injuries to employee were subject to workmen's
   compensation law and that plaintiff was estopped to sue by accepting
   benefits cannot be raised by motion to dismiss but should be asserted
   by answer. Roberts v. Epicure Foods Co. (Mo.), 330 S.W.2d 837.

    (1960) Fact that employee who is required to work in place where she
   necessarily inhaled noxious fumes with the result that she contracted
   pulmonary emphysema did not render the workmen's compensation law of
   Missouri inapplicable to her injury. Common law action for negligence
   of employer dismissed. Oggesen v. General Cable Corp., 273 F.2d 331.

    (1962) Where maintenance man in attempting to unlock a perforating
   machine placed a pipe over wrench handle and bounced up and down on
   end of pipe thereby sustaining back injury, the injury was an accident
   and compensable. Brotherton v. International Shoe Company (A.),
   360 S.W.2d 108.

    (1962) Evidence supported finding claimant as result of fall suffered
   fifteen percent permanent partial disability of left arm where elbow
   was enlarged and would tire during the day although there was no loss
   of motion and claimant suffered no loss of earnings. Franklin v.
   St. Louis Independent Packing Company (A.), 360 S.W.2d 350.

    (1963) Evidence was sufficient to justify finding of industrial
   commission that claimant sustained an accident when he slipped on
   floor and twisted his back while holding a sixty-pound sack of sugar
   and fell resulting in injuries to his lower back notwithstanding his
   medical testimony was only to the effect that it was possible that
   the accident resulted in the back injury. Smith v. Terminal Transfer
   Company (A.), 372 S.W.2d 659.

    (1967) Where employee was injured in automobile accident while on the
   way to work in transportation furnished by the employer, the
   transportation was an implied term of and within the scope of the
   employment contract, and the accident arose out of and in the course
   of employee's employment. Griffin v. Ross (A.), 411 S.W.2d 649.

    (1967) An accidental injury "arises out of" employment only when
   there is a causal connection between the employee's injury and his
   employment, and a claimant meets this requirement only when the
   injury is the rational consequence of an act incidental to his
   employment. Blatt v. Metropolitan Life Insurance Co. (A.), 413
   S.W.2d 533.

    (1967) A showing that claimant's job involved pulling two hundred
   and fifty pound car loaded with staves onto a skid and was done
   intentionally in accordance with preconceived design and that nothing
   unusual occurred other than claimant feeling a pain was not sufficient
   evidence to sustain the burden of proof that claimant had experienced
   an accident arising out of and in the course of his employment.
   Bauer v. Independent Stave Co. (A.), 417 S.W.2d 693.

    (1968) Driver hired by delivery service to work exclusively on hauling
   for cooperage company, under the direction and control of cooperage
   company, was employee of cooperage company for workmen's compensation
   purposes. Feldmann v. Dot Delivery Service (A.), 425 S.W.2d 491.

    (1980) Exclusive remedy of parents of deceased worker for
   compensation for alleged wrongful death of worker in employment
   accident under Workers' Compensation Law; overruling Miller v. Hotel
   Savoy Co. (A.), 68 S.W.2d 929. Combs v. City of Maryville (A.),
   609 S.W.2d 475.

    (1991) Where worker alleges wrongful discharge and intentional
   infliction of emotional distress, Missouri's workers'
   compensation law provides exclusive remedy for emotional distress
   inflicted during course of employment. Waldermeyer v. ITT
   Consumer Financial Corp., 767 F.Supp. 989 (E.D.Mo.).

    (1993) Where employee alleged former employer invaded her privacy
   because there was peep hole between her bathroom and
   supervisors'' bathroom, court ruled that in all instances where
   an injured person seeks to hold employer liable under any common
   law tort theory, including intentional torts, for injuries
   resulting from work experiences, Labor and Industrial Relations
   Commission has exclusive initial jurisdiction to determine
   whether injuries are result of an accident covered by workers''
   compensation. Massey v. Victor I. Phillips Co., 827 F.Supp. 597
   (W.D.Mo.).

    (1993) Where police officer alleged intentional torts by city and by
   co-employees individually, claim against city was barred by
   workers'' compensation act; however, claims against individual
   co-employees, including police chief, were not barred by
   workers'' compensation act. Russell v. City of Overland Police
   Dept., 838 F.Supp 1350 (E.D.Mo.).

    (1993) Where claimant who was employed by company based in Jefferson
   City was traveling home from job site at Lake of the Ozarks with
   saw belonging to company in car, travel did not serve mutual
   benefit and dual purpose doctrine did not apply. Accident did
   not occur on employer's premises or at work site; therefore,
   claim did not fall within workers' compensation act. Stockman
   v. J.C. Industries, Inc., 854 S.W.2d 24 (Mo.App.W.D.).

===================================================================



 

Definitions--intent to abrogate earlier case law.287.020. 1. The word "employee" as used in this chapter shall be construed to mean every person in the service of any employer, as defined in this chapter, under any contract of hire, express or implied, oral or written, or under any appointment or election, including executive officers of corporations. Except as otherwise provided in section 287.200, any reference to any employee who has been injured shall, when the employee is dead, also include his dependents, and other persons to whom compensation may be payable. The word "employee" shall also include all minors who work for an employer, whether or not such minors are employed in violation of law, and all such minors are hereby made of full age for all purposes under, in connection with, or arising out of this chapter. The word "employee" shall not include an individual who is the owner, as defined in subsection 43 of section 301.010, and operator of a motor vehicle which is leased or contracted with a driver to a for-hire motor carrier operating within a commercial zone as defined in section 390.020 or 390.041, or operating under a certificate issued by the Missouri department of transportation or by the United States Department of Transportation, or any of its subagencies. The word "employee" also shall not include any person performing services for board, lodging, aid, or sustenance received from any religious, charitable, or relief organization. 2. The word "accident" as used in this chapter shall mean an unexpected traumatic event or unusual strain identifiable by time and place of occurrence and producing at the time objective symptoms of an injury caused by a specific event during a single work shift. An injury is not compensable because work was a triggering or precipitating factor. 3. (1) In this chapter the term "injury" is hereby defined to be an injury which has arisen out of and in the course of employment. An injury by accident is compensable only if the accident was the prevailing factor in causing both the resulting medical condition and disability. "The prevailing factor" is defined to be the primary factor, in relation to any other factor, causing both the resulting medical condition and disability. (2) An injury shall be deemed to arise out of and in the course of the employment only if: (a) It is reasonably apparent, upon consideration of all the circumstances, that the accident is the prevailing factor in causing the injury; and (b) It does not come from a hazard or risk unrelated to the employment to which workers would have been equally exposed outside of and unrelated to the employment in normal nonemployment life. (3) An injury resulting directly or indirectly from idiopathic causes is not compensable. (4) A cardiovascular, pulmonary, respiratory, or other disease, or cerebrovascular accident or myocardial infarction suffered by a worker is an injury only if the accident is the prevailing factor in causing the resulting medical condition. (5) The terms "injury" and "personal injuries" shall mean violence to the physical structure of the body and to the personal property which is used to make up the physical structure of the body, such as artificial dentures, artificial limbs, glass eyes, eyeglasses, and other prostheses which are placed in or on the body to replace the physical structure and such disease or infection as naturally results therefrom. These terms shall in no case except as specifically provided in this chapter be construed to include occupational disease in any form, nor shall they be construed to include any contagious or infectious disease contracted during the course of the employment, nor shall they include death due to natural causes occurring while the worker is at work. 4. "Death" when mentioned as a basis for the right to compensation means only death resulting from such violence and its resultant effects occurring within three hundred weeks after the accident; except that in cases of occupational disease, the limitation of three hundred weeks shall not be applicable. 5. Injuries sustained in company-owned or subsidized automobiles in accidents that occur while traveling from the employee's home to the employer's principal place of business or from the employer's principal place of business to the employee's home are not compensable. The extension of premises doctrine is abrogated to the extent it extends liability for accidents that occur on property not owned or controlled by the employer even if the accident occurs on customary, approved, permitted, usual or accepted routes used by the employee to get to and from their place of employment. 6. The term "total disability" as used in this chapter shall mean inability to return to any employment and not merely mean inability to return to the employment in which the employee was engaged at the time of the accident. 7. As used in this chapter and all acts amendatory thereof, the term "commission" shall hereafter be construed as meaning and referring exclusively to the labor and industrial relations commission of Missouri, and the term "director" shall hereafter be construed as meaning the director of the department of insurance, financial institutions and professional registration of the state of Missouri or such agency of government as shall exercise the powers and duties now conferred and imposed upon the department of insurance, financial institutions and professional registration of the state of Missouri. 8. The term "division" as used in this chapter means the division of workers' compensation of the department of labor and industrial relations of the state of Missouri. 9. For the purposes of this chapter, the term "minor" means a person who has not attained the age of eighteen years; except that, for the purpose of computing the compensation provided for in this chapter, the provisions of section 287.250 shall control. 10. In applying the provisions of this chapter, it is the intent of the legislature to reject and abrogate earlier case law interpretations on the meaning of or definition of "accident", "occupational disease", "arising out of", and "in the course of the employment" to include, but not be limited to, holdings in: Bennett v. Columbia Health Care and Rehabilitation, 80 S.W.3d 524 (Mo.App. W.D. 2002); Kasl v. Bristol Care, Inc., 984 S.W.2d 852 (Mo.banc 1999); and Drewes v. TWA, 984 S.W.2d 512 (Mo.banc 1999) and all cases citing, interpreting, applying, or following those cases. 11. For the purposes of this chapter, "occupational diseases due to toxic exposure" shall only include the following: mesothelioma, asbestosis, berylliosis, coal worker's pneumoconiosis, brochiolitis obliterans, silicosis, silicotuberculosis, manganism, acute myelogenous leukemia, and myelodysplastic syndrome.

Member of limited liability company to receive coverage, rejection of
coverage, rescission of rejection.

beginning January 1, 1997, those insurance companies providing coverage
pursuant to chapter 287, to a limited liability company, as defined in section

liability company who are not members of the limited liability company.
Members of the limited liability company, as defined in section 347.015, RSMo,

individually elect to reject such coverage by providing a written notice of
such rejection on a form developed by the department of insurance, financial
institutions and professional registration to the limited liability company
and its insurer. Failure to provide notice to the limited liability company
shall not be grounds for any member to claim that the rejection of such
coverage is not legally effective. A member who elects to reject such
coverage shall not thereafter be entitled to workers' compensation benefits
under the policy, even if serving or working in the capacity of an employee of
the limited liability company, at least until such time as said member
provides the limited liability company and its insurer with a written notice
which rescinds the prior rejection of such coverage. The written notice which
rescinds the prior rejection of such coverage shall be on a form developed by
the department of insurance, financial institutions and professional
registration. Any rescission shall be prospective in nature and shall entitle
the member only to such benefits which accrue on or after the date the notice
of rescission form is received by the insurance company.    (L. 1996 H.B. 1368 Â§ 1)

insurers upon request. Failure to request such notice does not relieve the
employer of its obligation to post the notice. If the employer carries
workers' compensation insurance, the carrier shall provide the notice to
the insured within thirty days of the insurance policy's inception date.
  3. Any employer who willfully violates the provisions of this section
shall be guilty of a class A misdemeanor and shall be punished by a fine of
not less than fifty dollars nor more than one thousand dollars, or by
imprisonment in the county jail for not more than six months or by both
such fine and imprisonment, and each such violation or each day such
violation continues shall be deemed a separate offense.

287.129. 1. A health care provider commits a fraudulent workers' compensation insurance act if he or she knowingly and with intent to defraud presents, causes to be presented, or prepares with knowledge or belief that it will be presented, to or by an insurer, purported insurer, broker, or any agent thereof, any claim for payment or other benefit which involves any one or more of the following false billing practices:
(1) "Unbundling" an insurance claim by claiming a number of medical procedures were performed instead of a single comprehensive procedure;
(2) "Upcoding" a medical, hospital or rehabilitative insurance claim by claiming that a more serious or extensive procedure was performed than was actually performed;
(3) "Exploding" a medical, hospital or rehabilitative insurance claim by claiming a series of tests were performed on a single sample of blood, urine, or other bodily fluid, when actually the series of tests were part of one battery of tests; or
(4) "Duplicating" a medical, hospital or rehabilitative insurance claim made by a health care provider by resubmitting the claim through another health care provider in which the original health care provider has an ownership interest.
Nothing in this section shall prohibit providers from making good faith efforts to ensure that claims for reimbursement are coded to reflect the proper diagnosis and treatment.

287.135. Managed care services, department to establish program to certify
organizations, procedures--effect on fees and services.
  1. The department of insurance, financial institutions and
professional registration shall establish a program whereby managed care
organizations in this state shall be certified by the department for the
provision of managed care services to employers who voluntarily choose to use
such organizations. The department shall report to the division of workers'
compensation all managed care organizations certified pursuant to the
provisions of this section. The division shall maintain a registry of
certified managed care organizations that can be readily accessed by employers
for the provision of managed care services. For the purposes of this section,
the term "managed care organizations" shall mean organizations such as
preferred provider organizations, health maintenance organizations and other
direct employer/provider arrangements which have been certified by the
department designed to provide incentives to medical care providers to manage
the cost and use of care associated with claims covered by workers'
compensation insurance.
  2. The director of the department of insurance, financial institutions
and professional registration shall promulgate rules which set out the
approval criteria for certification of a managed care organization. Approval
criteria shall take into consideration the adequacy of services that the
organization will be able to offer the employer, the geographic area to be
served, staff size and makeup of the organization in relation to both services
offered and geographic location, access to health care providers, the adequacy
of internal management and oversight, the adequacy of procedures for peer
review, utilization review, and internal dispute resolution, including a
method to resolve complaints by injured employees, medical providers, and
insurers over the cost, necessity and appropriateness of medical services, the
availability of case management services, and any other criteria as determined
by the director. Thirty days prior to the annual anniversary of any current
certification granted by the director, any managed care organization seeking
continued certification shall file an application for recertification with the
director, on a form approved by the director, accompanied by a filing fee
established by the director by rule and any other materials specified by the
director.
  3. The director of the department of insurance, financial institutions
and professional registration shall promulgate rules which set out the
criteria under which the fees charged by a managed care organization shall be
reimbursed by an employer's workers' compensation insurer and which establish
criteria providing for the coordination and integration between the managed
care organization and the insurer of their respective internal operational
systems relating to such matters as claim reporting and handling, medical case
management procedures and billing. Such criteria shall require any such
reimbursable fees to be reasonable in relation both to the managed care
services provided and to the savings which result from those services. Such
criteria shall discourage the use of fee arrangements which result in
unjustified costs being billed for either medical services or managed care
services. Insurers and managed care organizations shall be permitted to
voluntarily negotiate and utilize alternative fee arrangements.
Notwithstanding any provision of this subsection to the contrary, if an
insurer and a managed care organization enter into a voluntary agreement that
accomplishes the same purposes as this subsection, that insurer and that
managed care organization with respect to that agreement shall not be required
to meet the requirements of this subsection or regulations promulgated by the
department pursuant to this subsection.
  4. Any managed care organization, including any managed care
organization that has been established or selected by or has contracted with a
workers' compensation insurance carrier to provide managed care services to
insured employers, that has previously been certified prior to August 28,
1993, by the director of the department of insurance, financial institutions
and professional registration shall be deemed to have met the criteria set
forth in this section.
  5. The necessity and appropriateness of medical care services
recommended or provided by providers shall be subject to review by the
division of workers' compensation, upon application, following a decision by
the managed care organization's utilization review and dispute resolution
review and appeal procedure. The decision of the managed care organization
relating to payment for such medical care services shall be subject to
modification by the division of workers' compensation, after mediation
conference or hearing, only upon showing that it was unreasonable, arbitrary
or capricious.    (L. 1993 S.B. 251)

Employer to provide medical and other services, transportation,artificial devices, reactivation of claim--duties of health careproviders--refusal of treatment, effect--medical evidence--division,commission responsibilities--notice to health care provider ofworkers' compensation claim, contents, effect--use of employee leavetime.


1. In addition to all other compensation paid to the
employee under this section, the employee shall receive and the
employer shall provide such medical, surgical, chiropractic, and
hospital treatment, including nursing, custodial, ambulance and
medicines, as may reasonably be required after the injury or
disability, to cure and relieve from the effects of the injury. If
the employee desires, he shall have the right to select his own
physician, surgeon, or other such requirement at his own expense.
Where the requirements are furnished by a public hospital or other
institution, payment therefor shall be made to the proper
authorities. Regardless of whether the health care provider is
selected by the employer or is selected by the employee at the
employee's expense, the health care provider shall have the
affirmative duty to communicate fully with the employee regarding the
nature of the employee's injury and recommended treatment exclusive
of any evaluation for a permanent disability rating. Failure to
perform such duty to communicate shall constitute a disciplinary
violation by the provider subject to the provisions of chapter 620.
When an employee is required to submit to medical examinations or
necessary medical treatment at a place outside of the local or
metropolitan area from the employee's principal place of employment,
the employer or its insurer shall advance or reimburse the employee
for all necessary and reasonable expenses; except that an injured
employee who resides outside the state of Missouri and who is
employed by an employer located in Missouri shall have the option of
selecting the location of services provided in this section either at
a location within one hundred miles of the injured employee's
residence, place of injury or place of hire by the employer. The
choice of provider within the location selected shall continue to be
made by the employer. In case of a medical examination if a dispute
arises as to what expenses shall be paid by the employer, the matter
shall be presented to the legal advisor, the administrative law judge
or the commission, who shall set the sum to be paid and same shall be
paid by the employer prior to the medical examination. In no event,
however, shall the employer or its insurer be required to pay
transportation costs for a greater distance than two hundred fifty
miles each way from place of treatment.

2. If it be shown to the division or the commission that the
requirements are being furnished in such manner that there is
reasonable ground for believing that the life, health, or recovery of
the employee is endangered thereby, the division or the commission
may order a change in the physician, surgeon, hospital or other
requirement.

3. All fees and charges under this chapter shall be fair and
reasonable, shall be subject to regulation by the division or the
commission, or the board of rehabilitation in rehabilitation cases. A
health care provider shall not charge a fee for treatment and care
which is governed by the provisions of this chapter greater than the
usual and customary fee the provider receives for the same treatment
or service when the payor for such treatment or service is a private
individual or a private health insurance carrier. The division or the
commission, or the board of rehabilitation in rehabilitation cases,
shall also have jurisdiction to hear and determine all disputes as to
such charges. A health care provider is bound by the determination
upon the reasonableness of health care bills.

4. The division shall, by regulation, establish methods to resolve
disputes concerning the reasonableness of medical charges, services,
or aids. This regulation shall govern resolution of disputes between
employers and medical providers over fees charged, whether or not
paid, and shall be in lieu of any other administrative procedure
under this chapter. The employee shall not be a party to a dispute
over medical charges, nor shall the employee's recovery in any way be
jeopardized because of such dispute. Any application for payment of
additional reimbursement, as such term is used in 8 CSR 50-2.030, as
amended, shall be filed not later than:

(1) Two years from the date the first notice of dispute of the
medical charge was received by the health care provider if such
services were rendered before July 1, 2013; and

(2) One year from the date the first notice of dispute of the
medical charge was received by the health care provider if such
services were rendered after July 1, 2013.

Notice shall be presumed to occur no later than five business days
after transmission by certified United States mail.

5. No compensation shall be payable for the death or disability of
an employee, if and insofar as the death or disability may be caused,
continued or aggravated by any unreasonable refusal to submit to any
medical or surgical treatment or operation, the risk of which is, in
the opinion of the division or the commission, inconsiderable in view
of the seriousness of the injury. If the employee dies as a result of
an operation made necessary by the injury, the death shall be deemed
to be caused by the injury.

6. The testimony of any physician or chiropractic physician who
treated the employee shall be admissible in evidence in any
proceedings for compensation under this chapter, subject to all of
the provisions of section 287.210.

7. Every hospital or other person furnishing the employee with
medical aid shall permit its record to be copied by and shall furnish
full information to the division or the commission, the employer, the
employee or his dependents and any other party to any proceedings for
compensation under this chapter, and certified copies of the records
shall be admissible in evidence in any such proceedings.

8. The employer may be required by the division or the commission to
furnish an injured employee with artificial legs, arms, hands,
surgical orthopedic joints, or eyes, or braces, as needed, for life
whenever the division or the commission shall find that the injured
employee may be partially or wholly relieved of the effects of a
permanent injury by the use thereof. The director of the division
shall establish a procedure whereby a claim for compensation may be
reactivated after settlement of such claim is completed. The claim
shall be reactivated only after the claimant can show good cause for
the reactivation of this claim and the claim shall be made only for
the payment of medical procedures involving life-threatening surgical
procedures or if the claimant requires the use of a new, or the
modification, alteration or exchange of an existing, prosthetic
device. For the purpose of this subsection, "life threatening" shall
mean a situation or condition which, if not treated immediately, will
likely result in the death of the injured worker.

9. Nothing in this chapter shall prevent an employee being provided
treatment for his injuries by prayer or spiritual means if the
employer does not object to the treatment.

10. The employer shall have the right to select the licensed
treating physician, surgeon, chiropractic physician, or other health
care provider; provided, however, that such physicians, surgeons or
other health care providers shall offer only those services
authorized within the scope of their licenses. For the purpose of
this subsection, subsection 2 of section 287.030 shall not apply.

11. Any physician or other health care provider who orders, directs
or refers a patient for treatment, testing, therapy or rehabilitation
at any institution or facility shall, at or prior to the time of the
referral, disclose in writing if such health care provider, any of
his partners or his employer has a financial interest in the
institution or facility to which the patient is being referred, to
the following:

(1) The patient;

(2) The employer of the patient with workers' compensation liability
for the injury or disease being treated;

(3) The workers' compensation insurer of such employer; and

(4) The workers' compensation adjusting company for such insurer.

12. Violation of subsection 11 of this section is a class A
misdemeanor.

13. (1) No hospital, physician or other health care provider, other
than a hospital, physician or health care provider selected by the
employee at his own expense pursuant to subsection 1 of this section,
shall bill or attempt to collect any fee or any portion of a fee for
services rendered to an employee due to a work-related injury or
report to any credit reporting agency any failure of the employee to
make such payment, when an injury covered by this chapter has
occurred and such hospital, physician or health care provider has
received actual notice given in writing by the employee, the employer
or the employer's insurer. Actual notice shall be deemed received by
the hospital, physician or health care provider five days after
mailing by certified mail by the employer or insurer to the hospital,
physician or health care provider.

(2) The notice shall include:

(a) The name of the employer;

(b) The name of the insurer, if known;

(c) The name of the employee receiving the services;

(d) The general nature of the injury, if known; and

(e) Where a claim has been filed, the claim number, if known.

(3) When an injury is found to be noncompensable under this chapter,
the hospital, physician or other health care provider shall be
entitled to pursue the employee for any unpaid portion of the fee or
other charges for authorized services provided to the employee. Any
applicable statute of limitations for an action for such fees or
other charges shall be tolled from the time notice is given to the
division by a hospital, physician or other health care provider
pursuant to subdivision (6) of this subsection, until a determination
of noncompensability in regard to the injury which is the basis of
such services is made, or in the event there is an appeal to the
labor and industrial relations commission, until a decision is
rendered by that commission.

(4) If a hospital, physician or other health care provider or a debt
collector on behalf of such hospital, physician or other health care
provider pursues any action to collect from an employee after such
notice is properly given, the employee shall have a cause of action
against the hospital, physician or other health care provider for
actual damages sustained plus up to one thousand dollars in
additional damages, costs and reasonable attorney's fees.

(5) If an employer or insurer fails to make payment for authorized
services provided to the employee by a hospital, physician or other
health care provider pursuant to this chapter, the hospital,
physician or other health care provider may proceed pursuant to
subsection 4 of this section with a dispute against the employer or
insurer for any fees or other charges for services provided.

(6) A hospital, physician or other health care provider whose
services have been authorized in advance by the employer or insurer
may give notice to the division of any claim for fees or other
charges for services provided for a work-related injury that is
covered by this chapter, with copies of the notice to the employee,
employer and the employer's insurer. Where such notice has been
filed, the administrative law judge may order direct payment from the
proceeds of any settlement or award to the hospital, physician or
other health care provider for such fees as are determined by the
division. The notice shall be on a form prescribed by the division.

14. The employer may allow or require an employee to use any of the
employee's accumulated paid leave, personal leave, or medical or sick
leave to attend to medical treatment, physical rehabilitation, or
medical evaluations during work time. The intent of this subsection
is to specifically supercede and abrogate any case law that
contradicts the express language of this section.

--->missouri--->Missouri Statutes--->287.141. Physical rehabilitation, defined, division of workers' compensation to administer--procedure. 
===================================================================



 

Physical rehabilitation, defined, division of workers' compensation
to administer--procedure.
  287.141. The purpose of this section is to restore the
injured person as soon as possible and as nearly as possible to a
condition of self-support and maintenance as an able-bodied
worker by physical rehabilitation. The provisions of this
chapter relating to physical rehabilitation shall be under the
control of and administered by the director of the division of
workers' compensation. The division of workers' compensation
shall make such rules and regulations as may be necessary to
carry out the purposes of this section, subject to the approval
of the labor and industrial relations commission of Missouri.
  2. The division of workers' compensation shall continuously
study the problems of physical rehabilitation and shall
investigate all rehabilitation facilities, both private and
public, and upon such investigation shall approve as qualified
all such facilities, institutions and physicians as are capable
of rendering competent physical rehabilitation service for
seriously injured industrial workers. Rehabilitation facilities
shall include medical, surgical, hospital and physical
restoration services. No facility or institution shall be
considered as qualified unless it is equipped to provide physical
rehabilitation services for persons suffering either from some
specialized type of disability or general type of disability
within the field of industrial injury, and unless such facility
or institution is operated under the supervision of a physician
qualified to render physical rehabilitation service and is
staffed with trained and qualified personnel and has received a
certificate of qualification from the division of workers'
compensation. No physician shall be considered as qualified
unless he has had the experience prescribed by the division.
  3. In any case of serious injury involving disability
following the period of rendition of medical aid as provided by
subsection 1 of section 287.140, where physical rehabilitation is
necessary if the employer or insurer shall offer such physical
rehabilitation to the injured employee and such physical
rehabilitation is accepted by the employee, then in such case the
director of the division of workers' compensation shall be
immediately notified thereof and thereupon enter his approval to
such effect, and the director of the division of workers'
compensation shall requisition the payment of forty dollars per
week benefit from the second injury fund in the state treasury to
be paid to the employee while he is actually being rehabilitated,
and shall immediately notify the state treasurer thereof by
furnishing him with a copy of his order. But in no case shall
the period of physical rehabilitation extend beyond twenty weeks
except in unusual cases and then only by a special order of the
division of workers' compensation for such additional period as
the division may authorize.
  4. In all cases where physical rehabilitation is offered and
accepted or ordered by the division, the employer or insurer
shall have the right to select any physician, facility, or
institution that has been found qualified by the division of
workers' compensation as above set forth.
  5. If the parties disagree as to such physical
rehabilitation treatment, where such treatment appears necessary,
then either the employee, the employer, or insurer may file a
request with the division of workers' compensation for an order
for physical rehabilitation and the director of the division
shall hear the parties within ten days after the filing of the
request. The director of the division shall forthwith notify the
parties of the time and place of the hearing, and the hearing
shall be held at a place to be designated at the discretion of
the division. The director of the division may conduct such
hearing or he may direct one of the administrative law judges to
conduct same. Such hearing shall be informal in all respects.
The director of the division shall, after considering all
evidence at such hearing, within ten days make his order in the
matter, either denying such request or ordering the employer or
insurer within a reasonable time, to furnish physical
rehabilitation, and ordering the employee to accept the same, at
the expense of the employer or insurer. When the order requires
physical rehabilitation, it shall also include an order to
requisition the payment of forty dollars per week out of the
second injury fund in the state treasury to the injured employee
during such time as such employee is actually receiving physical
rehabilitation.
  6. In every case where physical rehabilitation shall be
ordered, the director of the division may, in his discretion,
order the employer or insurer to furnish transportation to the
injured employee to such rehabilitation facility or institution.
  7. As used in this section, the term "physical
rehabilitation" shall be deemed to include medical, surgical and
hospital treatment in the same respect as required to be
furnished under subsection 1 of section 287.140.
  8. An appeal from any order of the division of workers'

287.148. Loss of suitable, gainful employment, how determined--severe injury,
defined--plan, duration, costs allowed.
  1. Within one hundred and twenty days of the
date of the injury, the employer shall determine whether the
injured worker has sustained an injury that results in a loss of
suitable, gainful employment. If the employer can determine
that a loss of suitable, gainful employment has occurred, the
employer may retain the services of a rehabilitation
practitioner or a rehabilitation provider. A written
determination of this finding shall be sent to the division of
workers' compensation with copies to the employer, insurer,
employee and their representatives on forms approved by the
division. In the event that a determination cannot be
established, within the one hundred and twenty days of the date
of injury, due to the extent of the injury, the employer shall,
as regulated by the division of workers' compensation, continue
to review the status of the injured employee at appropriate
intervals to determine his loss of suitable, gainful employment.

employer, the rehabilitation practitioner or provider shall,
within ninety days:

employee, the employer and all treating physicians; and

an injured employee may require the services of a rehabilitation
practitioner or rehabilitation provider if he receives a
surgeon's report and other medical reports supplied by the
employer or employer's insurer that details an injury of
sufficient severity as described in this section.
  4. The initial period of a plan may not exceed a period of
twenty-six weeks, but only the employer may extend the period of
the plan for an additional twenty-six-week period. Any
extension shall be consistent with the initial plan and limited

Subrogation to rights of employee or dependents against third person,effect of recovery--construction design professional, immunityfrom liability, when, exception--waiver of subrogation rights oncertain contracts void, employer's lien on subrogation recovery,when--third party liability, subrogation, effect on.
287.150. 1. Where a third person is liable to the employee or to the dependents, for the injury or death, the employer shall be subrogated to the right of the employee or to the dependents against such third person, and the recovery by such employer shall not be limited to the amount payable as compensation to such employee or dependents, but such employer may recover any amount which such employee or his dependents would have been entitled to recover. Any recovery by the employer against such third person shall be apportioned between the employer and employee or his dependents using the provisions of subsections 2 and 3 of this section.
2. When a third person is liable for the death of an employee and compensation is paid or payable under this chapter, and recovery is had by a dependent under this chapter either by judgment or settlement for the wrongful death of the employee, the employer shall have a subrogation lien on any recovery and shall receive or have credit for sums paid or payable under this chapter to any of the dependents of the deceased employee to the extent of the settlement or recovery by such dependents for the wrongful death. Recovery by the employer and credit for future installments shall be computed using the provisions of subsection 3 of this section relating to comparative fault of the employee.
3. Whenever recovery against the third person is effected by the employee or his dependents, the employer shall pay from his share of the recovery a proportionate share of the expenses of the recovery, including a reasonable attorney fee. After the expenses and attorney fee have been paid, the balance of the recovery shall be apportioned between the employer and the employee or his dependents in the same ratio that the amount due the employer bears to the total amount recovered if there is no finding of comparative fault on the part of the employee, or the total damages determined by the trier of fact if there is a finding of comparative fault on the part of the employee. Notwithstanding the foregoing provision, the balance of the recovery may be divided between the employer and the employee or his dependents as they may otherwise agree. Any part of the recovery found to be due to the employer, the employee or his dependents shall be paid forthwith and any part of the recovery paid to the employee or his dependents under this section shall be treated by them as an advance payment by the employer on account of any future installments of compensation in the following manner:
(1) The total amount paid to the employee or his dependents shall be treated as an advance payment if there is no finding of comparative fault on the part of the employee; or
(2) A percentage of the amount paid to the employee or his dependents equal to the percentage of fault assessed to the third person from whom recovery is made shall be treated as an advance payment if there is a finding of comparative fault on the part of the employee.
4. In any case in which an injured employee has been paid benefits from the second injury fund as provided in subsection 3 of section 287.141, and recovery is had against the third party liable to the employee for the injury, the second injury fund shall be subrogated to the rights of the employee against said third party to the extent of the payments made to him from such fund, subject to provisions of subsections 2 and 3 of this section.
5. No construction design professional who is retained to perform professional services on a construction project or any employee of a construction design professional who is assisting or representing the construction design professional in the performance of professional services on the site of the construction project shall be liable for any injury resulting from the employer's failure to comply with safety standards on a construction project for which compensation is recoverable under the workers' compensation law, unless responsibility for safety practices is specifically assumed by contract. The immunity provided by this subsection to any construction design professional shall not apply to the negligent preparation of design plans or specifications.
6. Any provision in any contract or subcontract, where one party is an employer in the construction group of code classifications, which purports to waive subrogation rights provided under this section in anticipation of a future injury or death is hereby declared against public policy and void. Each contract of insurance for workers' compensation shall require the insurer to diligently pursue all subrogation rights of the employer and shall require the employer to fully cooperate with the insurer in pursuing such recoveries, except that the employer may enter into compromise agreements with an insurer in lieu of the insurer pursuing subrogation against another party. The amount of any subrogation recovery by an insurer shall be credited against the amount of the actual paid losses in the determination of such employer's experience modification factor within forty-five days of the collection of such amount.
7. Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, when a third person or party is liable to the employee, to the dependents of an employee, or to any person eligible to sue for the employee's* wrongful death as provided is section 537.080 in a case where the employee suffers or suffered from an occupational disease due to toxic exposure and the employee, dependents, or persons eligible to sue for wrongful death are compensated under this chapter, in no case shall the employer then be subrogated to the rights of an employee, dependents, or persons eligible to sue for wrongful death against such third person or party when the occupational disease due to toxic exposure arose from the employee's work for employer.

Waiting period--compensation, how paid--interest, how computed--not
credit to employer for wages or benefits paid, exception.
  287.160. 1. Except as provided in section 287.140, no compensation
shall be payable for the first three days or less of disability during
which the employer is open for the purpose of operating its business or
enterprise unless the disability shall last longer than fourteen days. If
the disability lasts longer than fourteen days, payment for the first three
days shall be made retroactively to the claimant.
  2. Compensation shall be payable as the wages were paid prior to the
injury, but in any event at least once every two weeks. If an injured
employee claims benefits pursuant to this section, an employer may, if the
employee agrees in writing, pay directly to the employee any benefits due
pursuant to section 287.170. The employer shall continue such payments
until the insurer starts making the payments or the claim is contested by
any party. Where the claim is found to be compensable the employer's
workers' compensation insurer shall indemnify the employer for any payments
made pursuant to this subsection. If the employee's claim is found to be
fraudulent or noncompensable, after a hearing, the employee shall reimburse
the employer, or the insurer if the insurer has indemnified the employer,
for any benefits received either by a:
  (1) Lump sum payment;
  (2) Refund of the compensation equivalent of any accumulated sick or
disability leave;
  (3) Payroll deduction; or
  (4) Secured installment plan.
If the employee is no longer employed by such employer, the employer may
garnish the employee's wages or execute upon any property, except real
estate, of the employee. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to
require any employer to make payments directly to the employee.
  3. Where weekly benefit payments that are not being contested by the
employer or his insurer are due, and if such weekly benefit payments are
made more than thirty days after becoming due, the weekly benefit payments
that are late shall be increased by ten percent simple interest per annum.
Provided, however, that if such claim for weekly compensation is contested
by the employee, and the employer or his insurer have not paid the disputed
weekly benefit payments or lump sum within thirty days of when the
administrative law judge's order becomes final, or from the date of a
decision by the labor and industrial relations commission, or from the date
of the last judicial review, whichever is later, interest on such disputed
weekly benefit payments or lump sum so ordered, shall be increased by ten
percent simple interest per annum beginning thirty days from the date of
such order. Provided, however, that if such claims for weekly compensation
are contested solely by the employer or insurer, no interest shall be
payable until after thirty days after the award of the administrative law
judge. The state of Missouri or any of its political subdivisions, as an
employer, is liable for any such interest assessed against it for failure
to promptly pay on any award issued against it under this chapter.
  4. Compensation shall be payable in accordance with the rules given
in sections 287.170, 287.180, 287.190, 287.200, 287.240, and 287.250.
  5. The employer shall not be entitled to credit for wages or such pay
benefits paid to the employee or his dependents on account of the injury or
death except as provided in section 287.270.    Prior revision: 1929 Â§ 3312

weekly compensation shall in no event be less than forty dollars per week.
  2. Temporary total disability payments shall be made to the claimant by
check or other negotiable instruments approved by the director which will not
result in delay in payment and shall be forwarded directly to the claimant
without intervention, or, when requested, to claimant's attorney if
represented, except as provided in section 454.517, RSMo, by any other party
except by order of the division of workers' compensation.
  3. An employee is disqualified from receiving temporary total disability
during any period of time in which the claimant applies and receives
unemployment compensation.
  4. If the employee is terminated from post-injury employment based upon
the employee's post-injury misconduct, neither temporary total disability nor
temporary partial disability benefits under this section or section* 287.180
are payable. As used in this section, the phrase "post-injury misconduct"
shall not include absence from the workplace due to an injury unless the

schedule of losses.
  4. If an employee is seriously and permanently disfigured about the
head, neck, hands or arms, the division or commission may allow such
additional sum for the compensation on account thereof as it may deem just,
but the sum shall not exceed forty weeks of compensation. If both the
employer and employee agree, the administrative law judge may utilize a
photograph of the disfigurement in determining the amount of such
additional sum.
  5. The amount of compensation to be paid under subsection 1 of this
section shall be computed as follows:
  (1) For all injuries occurring on or after September 28, 1983, but
before August 28, 1990, the weekly compensation shall be an amount equal to
sixty-six and two-thirds percent of the employee's average weekly earnings
as of the date of the injury; provided that the weekly compensation paid
under this subdivision shall not exceed an amount equal to forty-five
percent of the state average weekly wage, as such wage is determined by the
division of employment security, as of the July first immediately preceding
the date of injury;
  (2) For all injuries occurring on or after September 28, 1981, the
weekly compensation shall in no event be less than forty dollars per week;
  (3) For all injuries occurring on or after August 28, 1990, but
before August 28, 1991, the weekly compensation shall be an amount equal to
sixty-six and two-thirds percent of the employee's average weekly earnings
as of the date of the injury; provided that the weekly compensation paid
under this subdivision shall not exceed an amount equal to fifty percent of
the state average weekly wage;
  (4) For all injuries occurring on or after August 28, 1991, but
before August 28, 1992, the weekly compensation shall be an amount equal to
sixty-six and two-thirds percent of the employee's average weekly earnings
as of the date of the injury; provided that the weekly compensation paid
under this subdivision shall not exceed an amount equal to fifty-two
percent of the state average weekly wage;
  (5) For all injuries occurring on or after August 28, 1992, the
weekly compensation shall be an amount equal to sixty-six and two-thirds
percent of the employee's average weekly earnings as of the date of the
injury; provided that the weekly compensation paid under this subdivision
shall not exceed an amount equal to fifty-five percent of the state average
weekly wage.
  6. (1) "Permanent partial disability" means a disability that is
permanent in nature and partial in degree, and when payment therefor has
been made in accordance with a settlement approved either by an
administrative law judge or by the labor and industrial relations
commission, a rating established by medical finding, certified by a
physician, and approved by an administrative law judge or legal advisor, or
an award by an administrative law judge or the commission, the percentage
of disability shall be conclusively presumed to continue undiminished
whenever a subsequent injury to the same member or same part of the body
also results in permanent partial disability for which compensation under
this chapter may be due; provided, however, the presumption shall apply
only to compensable injuries which may occur after August 29, 1959.
  (2) Permanent partial disability or permanent total disability shall
be demonstrated and certified by a physician. Medical opinions addressing
compensability and disability shall be stated within a reasonable degree of
medical certainty. In determining compensability and disability, where
inconsistent or conflicting medical opinions exist, objective medical
findings shall prevail over subjective medical findings. Objective medical
findings are those findings demonstrable on physical examination or by
appropriate tests or diagnostic procedures.
  (3) Any award of compensation shall be reduced by an amount
proportional to the permanent partial disability determined to be a
preexisting disease or condition or attributed to the natural process of
aging sufficient to cause or prolong the disability or need of treatment.    Prior revision: 1929 Â§ 3315

--->missouri--->Missouri Statutes--->287.197. Occupational deafness--tests, claims, awards, liability of employer, effect of hearing aid.
===================================================================



 

Occupational deafness--tests, claims, awards, liability of employer,
effect of hearing aid.
  287.197. 1. Losses of hearing due to industrial noise for compensation
purposes shall be confined to the frequencies of five hundred, one thousand,
and two thousand cycles per second. Loss of hearing ability for frequency
tones above two thousand cycles per second are not to be considered as
constituting disability for hearing.
  2. The percent of hearing loss, for purposes of the determination of
compensation claims for occupational deafness, shall be calculated as the
average, in decibels, of the thresholds of hearing for the frequencies of five
hundred, one thousand, and two thousand cycles per second. Pure tone air
conduction audiometric instruments, approved by nationally recognized
authorities in this field, shall be used for measuring hearing loss. If the
losses of hearing average twenty-six decibels or less in the three
frequencies, such losses of hearing shall not then constitute any compensable
hearing disability. If the losses of hearing average ninety-two decibels or
more in the three frequencies, then the same shall constitute and be total or
one hundred percent compensable hearing loss. The decibel standards
established by this subsection are based on the most current ANSI occupational
hearing loss standard. The division shall, by rule, adopt any superseding
ANSI occupational hearing loss standards regarding testing frequencies and
decibel standards for measuring hearing loss.
  3. There shall be payable as permanent partial disability for total
occupational deafness of one ear forty-nine weeks of compensation; for total
occupational deafness of both ears, one hundred eighty weeks of compensation;
and for partial occupational deafness in one or both ears, compensation shall
be paid for such periods as are proportionate to the relation which the
hearing loss bears to the amount provided in this subsection for total loss of
hearing in one or both ears, as the case may be. The amount of the hearing
loss shall be reduced by the average amount of hearing loss from
nonoccupational causes found in the population at any given age, according to
the provisions hereinafter set forth.
  4. In measuring hearing disability, the lowest measured losses in each
of the three frequencies shall be added together and divided by three to
determine the average decibel loss. For every decibel of loss exceeding
twenty-six decibels an allowance of one and one-half percent shall be made up
to the maximum of one hundred percent which is reached at ninety-two decibels.
  5. In determining the binaural (both ears) percentage of loss, the
percentage of disability in the better ear shall be multiplied by five. The
resulting figure shall be added to the percentage of disability in the poorer
ear and the sum of the two divided by six. The final percentage shall
represent the binaural hearing disability.
  6. Before determining the percentage of hearing disability, in order to
allow for the average amount of hearing loss from nonoccupational causes found
in the population at any given age, there shall be deducted from the total
average decibel loss, one-half decibel for each year of the employee's age
over forty at the time of last exposure to industrial noise.
  7. No claim for compensation for occupational deafness may be filed
until after one month's separation from the type of noisy work for the last
employer in whose employment the employee was at any time during such
employment exposed to harmful noise, and the last day of such period of
separation from the type of noisy work shall be the date of disability.
  8. An employer shall become liable for the entire occupational deafness
to which his employment has contributed; but if previous deafness is
established by a hearing test or by other competent evidence, whether or not
the employee was exposed to noise within one month preceding such test, the
employer shall not be liable for previous loss so established nor shall he be
liable for any loss for which compensation has previously been paid or
awarded.
  9. No consideration shall be given to the question of whether or not the
ability of an employee to understand speech is improved by the use of a
hearing aid.

287.200. Permanent total disability, amount to be paid--suspension ofpayments, when--toxic exposure, treatment of claims.
 1. Compensation for permanent total disability shall bepaid during the continuance of such disability for the lifetime ofthe employee at the weekly rate of compensation in effect under thissubsection on the date of the injury for which compensation is beingmade. The word "employee" as used in this section shall not includethe injured worker's dependents, estate, or other persons to whomcompensation may be payable as provided in subsection 1 of section287.020. The amount of such compensation shall be computed as follows:(1) For all injuries occurring on or after September 28, 1983, butbefore September 28, 1986, the weekly compensation shall be an amountequal to sixty-six and two-thirds percent of the injured employee'saverage weekly earnings during the year immediately preceding theinjury, as of the date of the injury; provided that the weeklycompensation paid under this subdivision shall not exceed an amountequal to seventy percent of the state average weekly wage, as suchwage is determined by the division of employment security, as of theJuly first immediately preceding the date of injury;(2) For all injuries occurring on or after September 28, 1986, butbefore August 28, 1990, the weekly compensation shall be an amountequal to sixty-six and two-thirds percent of the injured employee'saverage weekly earnings during the year immediately preceding theinjury, as of the date of the injury; provided that the weeklycompensation paid under this subdivision shall not exceed an amountequal to seventy-five percent of the state average weekly wage, assuch wage is determined by the division of employment security, as ofthe July first immediately preceding the date of injury;(3) For all injuries occurring on or after August 28, 1990, butbefore August 28, 1991, the weekly compensation shall be an amountequal to sixty-six and two-thirds percent of the injured employee'saverage weekly earnings as of the date of the injury; provided thatthe weekly compensation paid under this subdivision shall not exceedan amount equal to one hundred percent of the state average weeklywage;(4) For all injuries occurring on or after August 28, 1991, theweekly compensation shall be an amount equal to sixty-six and two-thirds percent of the injured employee's average weekly earnings asof the date of the injury; provided that the weekly compensation paidunder this subdivision shall not exceed an amount equal to onehundred five percent of the state average weekly wage;(5) For all injuries occurring on or after September 28, 1981, theweekly compensation shall in no event be less than forty dollars perweek.2. Permanent total disability benefits that have accrued through thedate of the injured employee's death are the only permanent totaldisability benefits that are to be paid in accordance with section287.230. The right to unaccrued compensation for permanent totaldisability of an injured employee terminates on the date of theinjured employee's death in accordance with section 287.230, and doesnot survive to the injured employee's dependents, estate, or otherpersons to whom compensation might otherwise be payable.3. All claims for permanent total disability shall be determined inaccordance with the facts. When an injured employee receives an awardfor permanent total disability but by the use of glasses, prostheticappliances, or physical rehabilitation the employee is restored tohis regular work or its equivalent, the life payment mentioned insubsection 1 of this section shall be suspended during the time inwhich the employee is restored to his regular work or its equivalent.The employer and the division shall keep the file open in the caseduring the lifetime of any injured employee who has received an awardof permanent total disability. In any case where the life payment issuspended under this subsection, the commission may at reasonabletimes review the case and either the employee or the employer mayrequest an informal conference with the commission relative to theresumption of the employee's weekly life payment in the case.4. For all claims filed on or after January 1, 2014, foroccupational diseases due to toxic exposure which result in apermanent total disability or death, benefits in this chapter shallbe provided as follows:(1) Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, suchamount as due to the employee during said employee's life as providedfor under this chapter for an award of permanent total disability anddeath, except such amount shall only be paid when benefits undersubdivisions* (2) and (3) of this subsection have been exhausted;(2) For occupational diseases due to toxic exposure, but notincluding mesothelioma, an amount equal to two hundred percent of thestate's average weekly wage as of the date of diagnosis for onehundred weeks paid by the employer; and(3) In cases where occupational diseases due to toxic exposure arediagnosed to be mesothelioma:**(a) For employers that have elected to accept mesotheliomaliability under this subsection, an additional amount of threehundred percent of the state's average weekly wage for two hundredtwelve weeks shall be paid by the employer or group of employers suchemployer is a member of. Employers that elect to accept mesotheliomaliability under this subsection may do so by either insuring theirliability, by qualifying as a self-insurer, or by becoming a memberof a group insurance pool. A group of employers may enter into anagreement to pool their liabilities under this subsection. If suchgroup is joined, individual members shall not be required to qualifyas individual self-insurers. Such group shall comply with section287.223. In order for an employer to make such an election, theemployer shall provide the department with notice of such an electionin a manner established by the department. The provisions of thisparagraph shall expire on December 31, 2038; or**(b) For employers who reject mesothelioma under this subsection,then the exclusive remedy provisions under section 287.120 shall notapply to such liability. The provisions of this paragraph shallexpire on December 31, 2038; and(4) The provisions of subdivision (2) and paragraph (a) ofsubdivision (3) of this subsection shall not be subject to suspensionof benefits as provided in subsection 3 of this section; and(5) Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter to thecontrary, should the employee die before the additional benefitsprovided for in subdivision (2) and paragraph (a) of subdivision (3)of this subsection are paid, the additional benefits are payable tothe employee's spouse or children, natural or adopted, legitimate orillegitimate, in addition to benefits provided under section 287.240.If there is no surviving spouse or children and the employee hasreceived less than the additional benefits provided for insubdivision (2) and paragraph (a) of subdivision (3) of thissubsection the remainder of such additional benefits shall be paid asa single payment to the estate of the employee;(6) The provisions of subdivision (1) of this subsection shall notbe construed to affect the employee's ability to obtain medicaltreatment at the employer's expense or any other benefits otherwiseavailable under this chapter.5.

Death benefits and burial expenses, amount, to whom paid and when
paid--dependent defined--death benefits, how distributed--record of
dependents, employer to keep--dependents to report to division,
procedure.

the compensation therefor shall be as provided in this section:
  (1) In all cases the employer shall pay direct to the persons furnishing
the same the reasonable expense of the burial of the deceased employee not
exceeding five thousand dollars. But no person shall be entitled to
compensation for the burial expenses of a deceased employee unless he has
furnished the same by authority of the widow or widower, the nearest relative
of the deceased employee in the county of his death, his personal
representative, or the employer, who shall have the right to give the
authority in the order named. All fees and charges under this section shall
be fair and reasonable, shall be subject to regulation by the division or the
commission and shall be limited to such as are fair and reasonable for similar
service to persons of a like standard of living. The division or the
commission shall also have jurisdiction to hear and determine all disputes as
to the charges. If the deceased employee leaves no dependents, the death
benefit in this subdivision provided shall be the limit of the liability of
the employer under this chapter on account of the death, except as herein
provided for burial expenses and except as provided in section 287.140;
provided that in all cases when the employer admits or does not deny liability
for the burial expense, it shall be paid within thirty days after written
notice, that the service has been rendered, has been delivered to the
employer. The notice may be sent by registered mail, return receipt
requested, or may be made by personal delivery;
  (2) The employer shall also pay to the total dependents of the employee
a death benefit based on the employee's average weekly earnings during the
year immediately preceding the injury that results in the death of the
employee, as provided in section 287.250. The amount of compensation for
death, which shall be paid in installments in the same manner that
compensation is required to be paid under this chapter, shall be computed as
follows:
  (a) If the injury which caused the death occurred on or after September
28, 1983, but before September 28, 1986, the weekly compensation shall be an
amount equal to sixty-six and two-thirds percent of the employee's average
weekly earnings during the year immediately preceding the injury; provided
that the weekly compensation paid under this paragraph shall not exceed an
amount equal to seventy percent of the state average weekly wage, as such wage
is determined by the division of employment security, as of the July first
immediately preceding the date of injury. If there is a total dependent, no
death benefits shall be payable to partial dependents or any other persons
except as provided in subdivision (1) of this section;
  (b) If the injury which caused the death occurred on or after September
28, 1986, but before August 28, 1990, the weekly compensation shall be an
amount equal to sixty-six and two-thirds percent of the employee's average
weekly earnings during the year immediately preceding the injury; provided
that the weekly compensation paid under this paragraph shall not exceed an
amount equal to seventy-five percent of the state average weekly wage, as such
wage is determined by the division of employment security, as of the July
first immediately preceding the date of injury. If there is a total
dependent, no death benefit shall be payable to partial dependents or any
other persons except as provided in subdivision (1) of this section;
  (c) If the injury which caused the death occurred on or after August 28,
1990, but before August 28, 1991, the weekly compensation shall be an amount
equal to sixty-six and two-thirds percent of the injured employee's average
weekly earnings as of the date of the injury; provided that the weekly
compensation paid under this paragraph shall not exceed an amount equal to one
hundred percent of the state average weekly wage;
  (d) If the injury which caused the death occurred on or after August 28,
1991, the weekly compensation shall be an amount equal to sixty-six and
two-thirds percent of the injured employee's average weekly earnings as of the
date of the injury; provided that the weekly compensation paid under this
paragraph shall not exceed an amount equal to one hundred five percent of the
state average weekly wage;
  (e) If the injury which caused the death occurred on or after September
28, 1981, the weekly compensation shall in no event be less than forty dollars
per week;
  (3) If there are partial dependents, and no total dependents, a part of
the death benefit herein provided in the case of total dependents, determined
by the proportion of his contributions to all partial dependents by the
employee at the time of the injury, shall be paid by the employer to each of
the dependents proportionately;
  (4) The word "dependent" as used in this chapter shall be construed to
mean a relative by blood or marriage of a deceased employee, who is actually
dependent for support, in whole or in part, upon his or her wages at the time
of the injury. The following persons shall be conclusively presumed to be
totally dependent for support upon a deceased employee, and any death benefit
shall be payable to them to the exclusion of other total dependents:
  (a) A wife upon a husband with whom she lives or who is legally liable
for her support, and a husband upon a wife with whom he lives or who is
legally liable for his support; provided that on the death or remarriage of a
widow or widower, the death benefit shall cease unless there be other total
dependents entitled to any death benefits under this chapter. In the event of
remarriage, a lump sum payment equal in amount to the benefits due for a
period of two years shall be paid to the widow or widower. Thereupon the
periodic death benefits shall cease unless there are other total dependents
entitled to any death benefit under this chapter, in which event the periodic
benefits to which such widow or widower would have been entitled had he or she
not died or remarried shall be divided among such other total dependents and
paid to them during their period of entitlement under this chapter;
  (b) A natural, posthumous, or adopted child or children, whether
legitimate or illegitimate, under the age of eighteen years, or over that age
if physically or mentally incapacitated from wage earning, upon the parent
legally liable for the support or with whom he, she, or they are living at the
time of the death of the parent. In case there is a wife or a husband
mentally or physically incapacitated from wage earning, dependent upon a wife
or husband, and a child or more than one child thus dependent, the death
benefit shall be divided among them in such proportion as may be determined by
the commission after considering their ages and other facts bearing on the
dependency. In all other cases questions of total or partial dependency shall
be determined in accordance with the facts at the time of the injury, and in
such other cases if there is more than one person wholly dependent the death
benefit shall be divided equally among them. The payment of death benefits to
a child or other dependent as provided in this paragraph shall cease when the
dependent dies, attains the age of eighteen years, or becomes physically and
mentally capable of wage earning over that age, or until twenty-two years of

===================================================================



 

Compensation, computation of--average weekly wage, division or
commission may determine, when--additional compensation for
persons under twenty-one, when--multiple employers, computation
of coverage--weekly wage--compromise settlement.
  287.250. 1. Except as otherwise provided for in this chapter, the
method of computing an injured employee's average weekly earnings which
will serve as the basis for compensation provided for in this chapter shall
be as follows:
  (1) If the wages are fixed by the week, the amount so fixed shall be
the average weekly wage;
  (2) If the wages are fixed by the month, the average weekly wage
shall be the monthly wage so fixed multiplied by twelve and divided by
fifty-two;
  (3) If the wages are fixed by the year, the average weekly wage shall
be the yearly wage fixed divided by fifty-two;
  (4) If the wages were fixed by the day, hour, or by the output of the
employee, the average weekly wage shall be computed by dividing by thirteen
the wages earned while actually employed by the employer in each of the
last thirteen calendar weeks immediately preceding the week in which the
employee was injured or if actually employed by the employer for less than
thirteen weeks, by the number of calendar weeks, or any portion of a week,
during which the employee was actually employed by the employer. For
purposes of computing the average weekly wage pursuant to this subdivision,
absence of five regular or scheduled work days, even if not in the same
calendar week, shall be considered as absence for a calendar week. If the
employee commenced employment on a day other than the beginning of a
calendar week, such calendar week and the wages earned during such week
shall be excluded in computing the average weekly wage pursuant to this
subdivision;
  (5) If the employee has been employed less than two calendar weeks
immediately preceding the injury, the employee's weekly wage shall be
considered to be equivalent to the average weekly wage prevailing in the
same or similar employment at the time of the injury, except if the
employer has agreed to a certain hourly wage, then the hourly wage agreed
upon multiplied by the number of weekly hours scheduled shall be the
employee's average weekly wage;
  (6) If the hourly wage has not been fixed or cannot be ascertained,
or the employee earned no wage, the wage for the purpose of calculating
compensation shall be taken to be the usual wage for similar services where
such services are rendered by paid employees of the employer or any other
employer;
  (7) In computing the average weekly wage pursuant to subdivisions (1)
to (6) of this subsection, an employee shall be considered to have been
actually employed for only those weeks in which labor is actually performed
by the employee for the employer and wages are actually paid by the
employer as compensation for such labor.
  2. For purposes of this section, the term "gross wages" includes, in
addition to money payments for services rendered, the reasonable value of
board, rent, housing, lodging or similar advance received from the
employer, except if such benefits continue to be provided during the period
of the disability, then the value of such benefits shall not be considered
in calculating the average weekly wage of the employee. The term "wages",
as used in this section, includes the value of any gratuities received in
the course of employment from persons other than the employer to the extent
that such gratuities are reported for income tax purposes. "Wages", as
used in this section, does not include fringe benefits such as retirement,
pension, health and welfare, life insurance, training, Social Security or
other employee or dependent benefit plan furnished by the employer for the
benefit of the employee. Any wages paid to helpers or any money paid by
the employer to the employee to cover any special expenses incurred by the
employee because of the nature of his employment shall not be included in
wages.
  3. If an employee is hired by the employer for less than the number
of hours per week needed to be classified as a full-time or regular
employee, benefits computed for purposes of this chapter for permanent
partial disability, permanent total disability and death benefits shall be
based upon the average weekly wage of a full-time or regular employee
engaged by the employer to perform work of the same or similar nature and
at the number of hours per week required by the employer to classify the
employee as a full-time or regular employee, but such computation shall not
be based on less than thirty hours per week.
  4. If pursuant to this section the average weekly wage cannot fairly
and justly be determined by the formulas provided in subsections 1 to 3 of
this section, the division or the commission may determine the average
weekly wage in such manner and by such method as, in the opinion of the
division or the commission, based upon the exceptional facts presented,
fairly determine such employee's average weekly wage.
  5. In computing the compensation to be paid to an employee, who,
before the injury for which the employee claims compensation, was disabled
and drawing compensation under the provisions of this chapter, the
compensation for each subsequent injury shall be apportioned according to
the proportion of incapacity and disability caused by the respective
injuries which the employee may have suffered.
  6. For purposes of establishing a rate of compensation applicable
only to permanent partial disability, permanent total disability and death
benefits, pursuant to this chapter, the average weekly wage for an employee
who is under the age of twenty-one years shall be adjusted to take into
consideration the increased earning power of such employee until she or he
attains the age of twenty-one years and the average weekly wage for an
employee who is an apprentice or a trainee, and whose earnings would
reasonably be expected to increase, shall be adjusted to reflect a level of
expected increase, based upon completion of apprenticeship or traineeship,
provided that such adjustment of the average weekly wage shall not consider
expected increase for a period occurring more than three years after the
date of the injury.
  7. In all cases in which it is found by the division or the
commission that the employer knowingly employed a minor in violation of the
child labor laws of this state, a fifty percent additional compensation
shall be allowed.
  8. For an employee with multiple employments, as to the employee's
entitlement to any temporary total or temporary partial disability benefits
only pursuant to subsection 9 of section 287.220, and for no other
purposes, the employee's total average weekly wage shall be equal to the
sum of the total of the average weekly wage computed separately for each
employment pursuant to the provisions of this section to which the employee
is unable to return because of this injury.
  9. The parties, by agreement and with approval of an administrative
law judge, legal advisor or the commission, may enter into a compromise
lump sum settlement in either permanent total or permanent partial
disability cases which prorates the lump sum settlement over the life
expectancy of the injured worker. When such an agreement has been
approved, neither the weekly compensation rate paid throughout the case nor
the maximum statutory weekly rate applicable to the injury shall apply. No
compensation rate shall exceed the maximum statutory weekly rate as of the
date of the injury. Instead, the prorated rate set forth in the approved
settlement documents shall control and become the rate for that case. This
section shall be retroactive in effect.    Prior revision: 1929 Â§ 3320

Ifan employer or group of employers have qualified to self-insure theirliability under this chapter, the division of workers' compensationmay, if it finds after a hearing that the employer or group ofemployers are willfully and intentionally violating the provisions ofthis chapter with intent to defraud their employees of their right tocompensation, suspend or revoke the right of the employer or group ofemployers to self-insure their liability. If the employer or group ofemployers fail to comply with this section, an injured employee orhis dependents may elect after the injury either to bring an actionagainst such employer or group of employers to recover damages forpersonal injury or death and it shall not be a defense that theinjury or death was caused by the negligence of a fellow servant, orthat the employee had assumed the risk of the injury or death, orthat the injury or death was caused to any degree by the negligenceof the employee; or to recover under this chapter with thecompensation payments commuted and immediately payable; or, if theemployee elects to do so, he or she may file a request with thedivision for payment to be made for medical expenses out of thesecond injury fund as provided in subsection 7 of section 287.220.

When a group ofemployers enter into an agreement to pool their liabilities underthis chapter, individual members will not be required to qualify asindividual self-insurers.2. Groups of employers qualified to insure their liability pursuantto chapter 537 or this chapter shall utilize a uniform experiencerating plan promulgated by an approved advisory organization. Suchgroups shall develop experience ratings for their members based onthe plan. Nothing in this section shall relieve an employer fromremitting, without any charge to the employer, the employer's claimshistory to an approved advisory organization.3. For every entity qualified to group self-insure their liabilitypursuant to this chapter or chapter 537, each entity shall notauthorize total discounts for any individual member exceeding twenty-five percent beginning January 1, 1999.

--->missouri--->Missouri Statutes--->287.282. Employee leasing arrangements, coverage required.
===================================================================



 

Employee leasing arrangements, coverage required.
  287.282. 1. Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection 1 of section
287.280, every employer who obtains part of his work force from another entity
through an employee leasing arrangement, or who employs the services of an
entity through an employee leasing arrangement, may be required to cover his
liability under the provisions of this chapter, through separate coverages or
separate self-insurance on his leased employees and his nonleased employees.
The director of the department of insurance, financial institutions and
professional registration may, by rule, establish the standards and procedures
by which insurance coverage shall be provided to employers using only leased
employees, and to employers using both leased and nonleased employees. The
director of the division of workers' compensation may, by a rule, establish
the standards and procedures for qualification for self-insurance for
employers using only leased employees and for employers using both leased and
nonleased employees.
  2. Such rules shall include, but not be limited to, the registration of
employee leasing arrangements prior to their eligibility for insurance, or
self-insurance, the information reporting requirements for both employee
leasing arrangements and for employers who use such arrangements, the extent
to which a client employer's experience shall determine the premium or bond or
other security amount for coverage on leased employees, and the procedures by
which such coverage or self-insurance on leased employees shall be issued,
endorsed, audited, cancelled and nonrenewed.
  3. For purposes of this section, the term "employee leasing arrangement"
shall not include temporary help service arrangements which assign their
employees to clients for a finite period of time to support or supplement the
client's work force in special work situations, such as employee absences,
temporary skill shortages and seasonal workloads, and which are not knowingly
utilized as a mechanism of depriving one or more insurers of premiums which
otherwise are properly payable.
  4. When an employee leasing company leases employees to only one client
company and its affiliates, there is a rebuttable presumption that the client
company entered into an employee leasing arrangement to avoid the calculation
of the proper contribution rate for payment of workers' compensation through
insurance or self-insurance.    (L. 1992 H.B. 975 Â§ 2)

sufficient.
  287.300. If the employer is not insured his liability
hereunder shall be primary and direct. If he is insured his
liability shall be secondary and indirect, and his insurer shall
be primarily and directly liable hereunder to the injured
employee, his dependents or other persons entitled to rights
hereunder. On the request of the division or the commission and
at every hearing the employer shall produce and furnish it with a
copy of his policy of insurance, and on demand the employer shall
furnish the injured employee, or his dependents, with the correct
name and address of his insurer, and his failure to do so shall
be prima facie evidence of his failure to insure, but the
presumption shall be conclusively rebutted by an entry of
appearance of his insurer. Both the employer and his insurer
shall be parties to all agreements or awards of compensation, but
the same shall not be enforceable against the employer, except on
motion and proof of default by the insurer. Service on the
employer shall be sufficient to give the division or the
commission jurisdiction over the person of both the employer and
his insurer, and the appearance of the employer in any proceeding
shall also constitute the appearance of his insurer, provided
that after appearance by an insurer, the insurer shall be
entitled to notice of all proceedings hereunder.    Prior revision: 1929 Â§ 3325

===================================================================



 

Policies to be approved by department--deductible plans authorized,
requirements.
  287.310. 1. Every policy of insurance against liability under this
chapter shall be in accordance with the provisions of this chapter and shall
be in a form approved by the director of the department of insurance,
financial institutions and professional registration. Such policy shall
contain an agreement that the insurer accepts all of the provisions of this
chapter, that the same may be enforced by any person entitled to any rights
under this chapter as well as by the employer, that the insurer shall be a
party to all agreements or proceedings under this chapter, and his appearance
may be entered therein and jurisdiction over his person may be obtained as in
this chapter provided, and such covenants shall be enforceable notwithstanding
any default of the employer.
  2. Any insurer issuing a workers' compensation policy may offer, as a
part of the policy or as an optional endorsement to the policy, a deductible
plan or plans to allow the insured employer to self-insure for the deductible
amount, subject to the approval of the director of the department of
insurance, financial institutions and professional registration. No
deductible plan shall be approved which permits, directly or indirectly, any
part of the deductible to be charged to or passed on to an employee of the
insured employer.
  3. Any deductible plan authorized under this section may provide for the
agreement between the insurer and the insured employer regarding the
conditions under which the employer shall be responsible for the payment of
any deductible amount to the person or health care provider entitled to such
payment pursuant to this chapter, except that no deductible plan shall be
approved unless the insurer shall retain the ultimate responsibility for the
payment of compensable claims. Where the agreement provides for the payment
of the deductible amount by the insurer, the insurer shall pay all the
deductible amount applicable to a compensable claim directly to the person or
health care provider entitled to the benefit pursuant to this chapter, and
shall then be reimbursed by the insured employer for such payments. The
insured employer shall be liable to the insurer up to the limit of the
deductible, and any failure on the part of the insured employer to provide
such reimbursements shall be treated under the workers' compensation policy in
the same manner as a nonpayment of premium. An employer's failure to
reimburse deductible amounts to the insurer shall not cause the unpaid amount
to be paid from the second injury fund under section 287.220. The insurer
shall have the right to offset unpaid deductible amounts against unearned
premiums, if any, in the event of a cancellation of the policy.
  4. Deductible plans shall provide appropriate premium reductions, as
approved by the director of the department of insurance, financial
institutions and professional registration, to reflect the type and level of
the deductible amount selected. Losses paid by the employer under the
deductible shall be credited against the employer's experience modification
while the deductible option is used, unless the employer exercises the right
to purchase a gross reportable deductible plan.
  5. An insurer shall not be required to offer a deductible if, as a
result of a credit investigation, the insurer determines that the employer
does not have the financial ability to be responsible for the payment of
deductible amounts.
  6. An insurer shall service and, if necessary, defend all claims that
arise during the policy period, including those claims payable in whole or in
part from the deductible amount.
  7. No employer who self-insures for a deductible amount as provided in
this section shall harass, discharge, or otherwise discriminate against any
employee because the employee has taken any action or is considering taking
action which might result in the insured employer being required to pay a
deductible amount.
  8. Any rating organization or advisory organization authorized by the
provisions of section 287.330 may file on behalf of its members deductible
plans for approval by the director of the department of insurance, financial
institutions and professional registration.
  9. In calculating the administrative surcharge owed pursuant to the
provisions of this chapter for workers' compensation policies with deductible
options, the administrative surcharge owed will be based upon the total
premiums, which would have been paid for the deductible credit portion of the
policy. The second injury fund surcharge owed by the employer who purchases a
deductible policy will be assessed upon the total premiums which would have
been paid in the absence of the deductible option. The premium taxes owed
pursuant to this chapter for workers' compensation policies with deductible
options shall be assessed upon those total premiums paid upon the insurance
policy excluding the deductible credit portion of the policy. The portion of
the workers' compensation policy with a deductible option that is subject to
an administrative surcharge shall not be subject to premium taxes, nor with
respect to foreign insurance companies, the retaliatory tax imposed pursuant
to section 375.916, RSMo.
  10. The director of the department of insurance, financial institutions
and professional registration shall, by rule, specify any data reporting
requirements applicable to workers' compensation policies with deductible
options.    Prior revision: 1929 Â§ 3326

  287.335. 1. There is hereby established the "Workers' Compensation
Determinations Review Board" within the department of insurance, financial
institutions and professional registration which shall exist to review
determinations by an insurer or advisory organization regarding uniform code
classifications, basic manual rule interpretations, uniform experience rating
plan rule interpretations, calculations of an individual employer's
modification factor, Missouri assigned risk plan underwriting rule
interpretations, and any other related uniform rule interpretations not
addressed by department rule or regulation. The board shall consist of five
persons who shall be voting members appointed by the governor, with the advice
and consent of the senate, who shall serve at the pleasure of the governor.
Three members shall be representative of the interests of employers with at
least one being representative of employers whose employees are represented by
a labor union and at least one being representative of employers whose
employees are not represented by a labor union. One member shall be a
representative of the interests of insurers, and one member shall be a
representative of the interests of independent insurance agents. One member
representing employers shall act as chairman of the board elected by the
board. Not more than three members of the board shall belong to the same
political party. Each member shall serve for a term of three years, except
that of the members first appointed, two shall be appointed for a term of one
year, two for a term of two years, and one for a term of three years.
Vacancies on the board shall be filled for the unexpired term in the same
manner as original appointments are made. The state actuary and a
representative of a rating organization licensed by the state shall be
nonvoting members of the board, and their duties shall include advising the
board on matters relating to code classifications, including the creation of
new code classifications. The board members shall not receive any
compensation, except that such members shall be reimbursed for actual and
necessary expenses incurred in the performance of their duties. In addition,
the board may employ staff to perform the administrative duties of the board.
The department of insurance, financial institutions and professional
registration may charge a fee against the classification agent as the director
deems appropriate.
  2. Upon application of any employer, the board shall review the code
classification made on that employer. If the board determines that the
classification was erroneous, it may change the classification by placing the
employer under a different code classification already established or by
creating a new classification code, if the board determines that there is
sufficient experience to merit a new classification code. The establishment
of the rate for a new classification code shall be filed with the director of
the department of insurance, financial institutions and professional
registration by either the affected employer or employers or by any recognized
rating organization within ninety days of the establishment of the new
classification code by the board. The director of the department of
insurance, financial institutions and professional registration shall review
the filed rate according to section 287.955. Upon application of any
employer, the board shall review the calculation of an employer's experience
modification factor and may order a recalculation in the experience
modification factor if calculated erroneously under the formula as approved by
the director of the department of insurance, financial institutions and
professional registration, including an adjustment for any recovery from a
third party pursuant to the employer's right of subrogation. An appeal from
the determination of an appropriate classification by the board may be made to
the director of the department of insurance, financial institutions and
professional registration. The board may review code classifications of
individual self-insured employers and self-insured employers in a group
insurance arrangement.
  3. The board may also recommend changes to the uniform classification
system.
  4. The advisory organization that makes a uniform classification system
for use in setting rates in this state shall provide to the affected party or
his designated agent, at a reasonable charge, information used or considered
in determining the development purpose, scope and intended application of any
classification comprising such uniform classification system.    Effective 1-1-94

may revoke or suspend the authority of such carrier to do business in this
state, and in a proper case may apply for the appointment of a receiver for

approval of the director of the department of insurance, financial

unless they confer benefits upon injured employees or their dependents at
least equivalent to the benefits provided by this chapter, nor if they require
contributions from employees, unless they confer benefits in addition to those

Appeals shall lie to the commission from any decision, award or order made by
or under such substitute system. Such substitute system and insurance may be
terminated by the director of the department of insurance, financial
institutions and professional registration on reasonable notice and hearing to
the interested parties, if it shall appear that the same is not fairly
administered, or if its operation shall disclose latent defects threatening
its solvency or if for any other substantial reason it fails to accomplish the
purposes of this chapter; and in this case the director of the department of

has accepted or rejected the provisions of this chapter, shall within
thirty days after knowledge of the injury, file with the division under
such rules and regulations and in such form and detail as the division may
require, a full and complete report of every injury or death to any
employee for which the employer would be liable to furnish medical aid,
other than immediate first aid which does not result in further medical
treatment or lost time from work, or compensation hereunder had he accepted
this chapter, and every employer or insurer shall also furnish the division
with such supplemental reports in regard thereto as the division shall
require. All reports submitted under this subsection shall include the
name, address, date of birth and wages of the deceased or injured employee,
the time and cause of the accident, the nature and extent of the injury,
the name and address of the employee's and the employer's or insurer's
attorney of record, if any, the medical cost incurred in treating the
injured employee, the amount of lost work time of the employee as a result
of the injury and such other information as the director may reasonably
require in order to maintain in the division, accurate and complete data on
the impact of work-related injuries on the workers' compensation system.
The division shall collect and maintain such data in such a form as to be
readily retrieved and available for analysis by the division. Employers
shall report all injuries to their insurance carrier, or third-party
administrators, if applicable, within five days of the date of the injury
or within five days of the date on which the injury was reported to the
employer by the employee, whichever is later. Where an employer reports
injuries covered pursuant to this chapter to his insurer or third-party
administrator, the insurer or third-party administrator shall be
responsible for filing the report prescribed in this section.
  2. Every employer and his insurer, and every injured employee, his
dependents and every person entitled to any rights hereunder, and every
other person receiving from the division or the commission any blank
reports with direction to fill out the same shall cause the same to be
promptly returned to the division or the commission properly filled out and
signed so as to answer fully and correctly to the best of his knowledge
each question propounded therein, and a good and sufficient reason shall be
given for failure to answer any question.
  3. No information obtained under the provisions of this section shall

violates any of the provisions of this section, including any employer or
insurer who knowingly fails to report any accident under the provisions of
subsection 1 of this section, or anyone who knowingly makes a false report
or statement in writing to the division or the commission, shall be deemed
guilty of a misdemeanor and on conviction thereof shall be punished by a
fine of not less than fifty nor more than five hundred dollars, or by
imprisonment in the county jail for not less than one week nor more than
one year, or by both the fine and imprisonment.    Prior revision: 1929 Â§ 3332

Compromise settlements, how made--validity, effect, settlement with
minor dependents--employee entitled to one hundred percent of offer,
when.
  287.390. 1. Parties to claims hereunder may enter into voluntary
agreements in settlement thereof, but no agreement by an employee or his or
her dependents to waive his or her rights under this chapter shall be
valid, nor shall any agreement of settlement or compromise of any dispute
or claim for compensation under this chapter be valid until approved by an
administrative law judge or the commission, nor shall an administrative law
judge or the commission approve any settlement which is not in accordance
with the rights of the parties as given in this chapter. No such agreement
shall be valid unless made after seven days from the date of the injury or
death. An administrative law judge, or the commission, shall approve a
settlement agreement as valid and enforceable as long as the settlement is
not the result of undue influence or fraud, the employee fully understands
his or her rights and benefits, and voluntarily agrees to accept the terms
of the agreement.
  2. A compromise settlement approved by an administrative law judge or
the commission during the employee's lifetime shall extinguish and bar all
claims for compensation for the employee's death if the settlement
compromises a dispute on any question or issue other than the extent of
disability or the rate of compensation.
  3. Notwithstanding the provisions of section 287.190, an employee
shall be afforded the option of receiving a compromise settlement as a
one-time lump sum payment. A compromise settlement approved by an
administrative law judge or the commission shall indicate the manner of
payment chosen by the employee.
  4. A minor dependent, by parent or conservator, may compromise
disputes and may enter into a compromise settlement agreement, and upon
approval by an administrative law judge or the commission the settlement
agreement shall have the same force and effect as though the minor had been
an adult. The payment of compensation by the employer in accordance with
the settlement agreement shall discharge the employer from all further
obligation.
  5. In any claim under this chapter where an offer of settlement is
made in writing and filed with the division by the employer, an employee is
entitled to one hundred percent of the amount offered, provided such
employee is not represented by counsel at the time the offer is tendered.
Where such offer of settlement is not accepted and where additional
proceedings occur with regard to the employee's claim, the employee is
entitled to one hundred percent of the amount initially offered. Legal
counsel representing the employee shall receive reasonable fees for
services rendered.
  6. As used in this chapter, "amount in dispute" means the dollar
amount in excess of the dollar amount offered or paid by the employer. An
offer of settlement shall not be construed as an admission of liability.    Prior revision: 1929 Â§ 3333

by sections 287.470 and 287.480, may not be delegated, but such
power and duty shall be exercised exclusively by the commission;
and provided further, that the commission shall exercise no
authority with respect to the selection or tenure of office of
any individual appointed or employed by the division in the

===================================================================



 

Written notice of injury to be given to employer--exceptions.
  287.420. No proceedings for compensation for any accident under this
chapter shall be maintained unless written notice of the time, place and
nature of the injury, and the name and address of the person injured, has
been given to the employer no later than thirty days after the accident,
unless the employer was not prejudiced by failure to receive the notice.
No proceedings for compensation for any occupational disease or repetitive
trauma under this chapter shall be maintained unless written notice of the
time, place, and nature of the injury, and the name and address of the
person injured, has been given to the employer no later than thirty days
after the diagnosis of the condition unless the employee can prove the
employer was not prejudiced by failure to receive the notice.    Prior revision: 1929 Â§ 3336
    (1955) Burden of showing notice of accident was given, or a
   legal excuse for not giving it, or that employer was not
   prejudiced by failure to give notice, is on claimant, and failure
   to establish such fact is fatal to the claim. Brown v. Douglas
   Candy Company (A.), 277 S.W.2d 657.
    (1961) Where the employee's doctor called the employer
   within thirty days after the alleged accident and advised the
   employer's personnel director of the nature and scope of the
   injury and the fact that hospitalization was necessary, such
   conversation constituted notice to the employer within the
   meaning of the statute. Lawson v. Vendo Co. (A.), 353
   S.W.2d 113.
    (1962) Commission did not act in excess of its jurisdiction in
   giving award to claimant who failed to give written notice of
   injury to employer where commission found that employer
   had received actual notice and was not prejudiced by failure.
   Manning v. Manor Baking Co. (A.), 356 S.W.2d 505.
    (1968) There is no provision in this statute exempting a minor
   from the requirement to give written notice to the employer of
   the accident. Klopstein v. Schroll House Moving Co. (A.),
   425 S.W.2d 498.
    (1972) Employee's contention that affirmative defense of failure
   of employer to give statutory notice of injury was waived
   by employer's failure to plead such defense in answer overruled
   since denial by the employer-insurer that they had been
   given statutory notice of injury made of record in the prehearing
   proceeding was a virtual and de facto amendment of their
   answer so as to raise that defense as a justiciable and controverted
   issue. Snow v. Hicks Brothers Chevrolet, Inc. (A.), 480
   S.W.2d 97.
    (1972) Where employer received timely written notice of injury
   to employee from employee's physician, employee's claim
   for compensation, although filed more than one year after last
   payment of compensation, was not barred since employer's
   failure to file report of injury until after claim for compensation
   had been filed tolled the running of limitations against
   employee. Snow v. Hicks Brothers Chevrolet, Inc. (A.), 480
   S.W.2d 97.

Limitation as to action, exception.
  287.430. Except for a claim for recovery filed against the second
injury fund, no proceedings for compensation under this chapter shall be
maintained unless a claim therefor is filed with the division within two
years after the date of injury or death, or the last payment made under
this chapter on account of the injury or death, except that if the report
of the injury or the death is not filed by the employer as required by
section 287.380, the claim for compensation may be filed within three years
after the date of injury, death, or last payment made under this chapter on
account of the injury or death. The filing of any form, report, receipt,
or agreement, other than a claim for compensation, shall not toll the
running of the periods of limitation provided in this section. The filing
of the report of injury or death three years or more after the date of
injury, death, or last payment made under this chapter on account of the
injury or death, shall not toll the running of the periods of limitation
provided in this section, nor shall such filing reactivate or revive the
period of time in which a claim may be filed. A claim against the second
injury fund shall be filed within two years after the date of the injury or
within one year after a claim is filed against an employer or insurer
pursuant to this chapter, whichever is later. In all other respects the
limitations shall be governed by the law of civil actions other than for
the recovery of real property, but the appointment of a conservator shall
be deemed the termination of the legal disability from minority or
disability as defined in chapter 475, RSMo. The statute of limitations
contained in this section is one of extinction and not of repose.    Prior revision: 1929 Â§ 3337
    (1965) There is no legislative intent expressed in this section to
   extinguish completely a workmen's compensation claim if not filed
   within the period provided by the statute. Welborn v. Southern
   Equipment Company (Mo.), 395 S.W.2d 119.
    (1966) While the furnishing of an elastic bandage by the employer's
   nurse constituted medical aid to relieve from the effects of injury,
   the mere wearing of that elastic bandage did not toll the statute of
   limitations while wearing the bandage. Morgan v. Krey Packing Co.
   (A.), 403 S.W.2d 668.
    (1967) The word "treatment" does not include mere physical
   examination or mere diagnosis. Bryant v. Montgomery Ward & Co. (A.),
   416 S.W.2d 195.
    (1968) The limitation period does not begin to run until it becomes
   reasonably discoverable and apparent that a compensable injury has
   been sustained. Williams v. S.N. Long Warehouse Co. (A.), 426 S.W.2d
   725.
    (1976) Held, advice to treat ankle with "warm soaks" constituted
   "medical treatment" and that such treatment constituted "payment"
   sufficient to toll statute of limitations. Faries v. ACF Industries,
   Inc. (A.), 531 S.W.2d 93.
    (2002) Use of term "extinction" indicates legislative intent that the
   two-year limitation is substantive and jurisdictional rather than
   procedural and waivable. Marston v. Juvenile Justice Center, 88
   S.W.3d 534 (Mo.App.W.D.).

brought at law or in admiralty to recover damages in respect of
bodily injury or death on the ground that the person was an
employee and the defendant was an employer subject to and within
the meaning of this chapter, or when recovery is denied to any
person in an action brought under the provisions of a workers'
compensation law of any other state or jurisdiction on the ground
that the person was an employee under and subject to the
provisions of this chapter, the limitation of time prescribed in
section 287.430 shall begin to run from the date of the ultimate
termination or abandonment of such suit or compensation
proceeding, when such suit or compensation proceedings are filed

either party may make application for a hearing in regard to the
matters at issue and for a ruling thereon, except that no
application for a hearing shall be considered until fourteen days
after the receipt by the division of the report of accident
required under section 287.380. The fourteen-day waiting period
is not applicable to applications for hardship hearings. After
the application has been received, the division shall set a date
for a hearing, which shall be held as soon as practicable, and
shall notify the interested parties of the time and place of the
hearing.    Prior revision: 1929 Â§ 3338

Division hearings, findings sent to parties and insurer--mediation
services, division to establish procedures, requirements.
  287.460. 1. The division, through an administrative law judge, shall
hear in a summary proceeding the parties at issue and their representatives
and witnesses and shall determine the dispute by issuing the written award
within ninety days of the last day of the hearing. The hearing shall be
concluded within thirty days of the date of commencement of the hearing,
except in extraordinary circumstances where a lengthy trial or complex
issues necessitate a longer time than ninety days. All evidence introduced
at any such hearings shall be reported by a competent reporter appointed by
the division or be recorded by electronic means. The award, together with
a statement of the findings of fact, rulings of law and any other matters
pertinent to the question at issue, shall be filed with the record of
proceedings, and a copy of the award shall immediately be sent by United
States mail to the parties in dispute and the employer's insurer.
  2. The division of workers' compensation shall develop by rule
procedures whereby mediation services are provided to the parties in a
claim for workers' compensation benefits whereby claims may be mediated by
the parties at a prehearing conference when the division determines that a
claim may be settled or upon application for a mediation settlement
conference filed by either party.
  3. The division may require the parties to produce at the mediation
conference all available medical records and reports. Such mediation
conference shall be informal to ascertain the issues and attempt to resolve
the claim or other pending issues. Such mediation conference may be set at
any time prior to the commencement of the evidentiary hearing and nothing
in this section shall be interpreted to delay the setting of the matter for
hearing. Upon the request of any party, a person providing mediation
settlement services shall be disqualified from conducting any evidentiary
hearing relating to the claim without limiting the rights conferred by
section 287.810.    Prior revision: 1929 Â§ 3339

Commission may review and change award.
  287.470. Upon its own motion or upon the application of any
party in interest on the ground of a change in condition, the
commission may at any time upon a rehearing after due notice to
the parties interested review any award and on such review may
make an award ending, diminishing or increasing the compensation
previously awarded, subject to the maximum or minimum provided in
this chapter, and shall immediately send to the parties and the
employer's insurer a copy of the award. No such review shall
affect such award as regards any moneys paid.    Prior revision: 1929 Â§ 3340
    (1951) In order to obtain award on ground of change in condition,
   injured employee must show his condition has grown
   worse, not that it was always worse than commission found it
   to be. Brammer v. Binkley Mining Co. (A.), 244 S.W.2d 584.
    (1963) Commission's finding that claimant, previously found
   to be totally and permanently disabled, who had become satisfactory
   full time employee of state hospital, had undergone
   substantial change in condition was supported by substantial
   evidence. Vandaveer v. Reinhart & Donovan Construction
   Co. (A.), 370 S.W.2d 156.
    (1981) The Labor and Industrial Relations Commission does
   not have jurisdiction to reopen a workers' compensation award
   after payment period has ended. Yokel v. Beta Corp. (A.),
   615 S.W.2d 78.
    (1985) The term "at any time" as it appears in this section
   means before payment of the award or before the expiration
   of the time during which the award is to be paid, whichever is
   later. Holman v. Normandy Osteopathic Hospital (A.), 691

  287.480. 1. If an application for review is made to the commission
within twenty days from the date of the award, the full commission, if the
first hearing was not held before the full commission, shall review the
evidence, or, if considered advisable, as soon as practicable hear the
parties at issue, their representatives and witnesses and shall make an
award and file it in like manner as specified in section 287.470. Any
notice of appeal, application or other paper required under this law to be
filed with the division or the commission shall, when mailed to or
transmitted by electronic facsimile meeting the requirements of the
division and received by the division or the commission, be deemed to be
filed as of the date endorsed by the United States post office on the
envelope or container in which such paper is received, or the date received
if filed by facsimile. In instances where the last day for the filing of
any such paper falls on a Sunday or legal holiday, the filing shall be
deemed timely if accomplished on the next day subsequent which is neither a
Sunday or a legal holiday. When filing by electronic facsimile meeting the
requirements of the division, the parties shall, on the same date as the
facsimile transmission, mail by the United States mail the original and the
requisite number of copies to the commission.
  2. An employer who has been determined by the division to be an
employer subject to and operating pursuant to this chapter and has also
been determined to be uninsured may file an application for review but such
application for review shall be accompanied with and attached to the
application for review a bond which shall be conditioned for the
satisfaction of the award in full, and if for any reason the appeal is
dismissed or if the award is affirmed or modified, to satisfy in full such
modification of the award as the commission may award. The surety on such
bond shall be a bank, savings and loan institution or an insurance company
licensed to do business in the state of Missouri. No appeal to the
commission shall be considered filed unless accompanied by such bond and
such bond shall also be a prerequisite for appeal as provided in section
287.495 and such appeal pursuant to section 287.495 shall not be considered
filed unless accompanied by such bond. If any other employer pursuant to
section 287.040 would be liable, the employee shall be paid benefits from
the bond until the bond is exhausted before the section 287.040 employer is
required to pay.    Prior revision: 1929 Â§ 3341

   evidence, industrial commission could reverse such finding and such
   reversal was not improper on ground referee alone saw and heard
   witnesses and was therefore the only one qualified to pass upon
   credibility. Diebold v. Great A. & P. Co. (A.), 241 S.W.2d 31.
    (1958) Application for review deemed made on date it was received by
   commission rather than on date it was deposited in mail so that

   commission had no jurisdiction to review referee's award. Tabb v.
   McGinley (A.), 313 S.W.2d 745.
    (1967) The filing of an application for review of a referee's award
   in a workmen's compensation case within the time prescribed by the
   statute provided for such a review is jurisdictional, and if the
   commission had no jurisdiction to review the referee's award then
   neither the circuit court nor the appeals court has jurisdiction to
   consider the appeal from the award of the commission. Luketich v.

Final award conclusive unless an appeal is taken--grounds for setting
aside--disputes governed by this section, claims arising before
August 13, 1980.
  287.490. 1. The final award of the commission shall be
conclusive and binding unless either party to the dispute shall
within thirty days from the date of the final award appeal to the
circuit court of the county in which the accident occurred, or if
the accident occurred outside of this state, then in the county
where the contract of employment was made. Such appeal may be
taken by filing notice of appeal with the commission, whereupon
the commission shall under its certificate return to the court
all documents and papers on file in the matter, together with a
transcript of the evidence, the findings and award, which shall
thereupon become the record of the cause. Upon appeal no
additional evidence shall be heard and in the absence of fraud,
the findings of fact made by the commission within its powers
shall be conclusive and binding. The court, on appeal, shall
review only questions of law and may modify, reverse, remand for
rehearing, or set aside the award upon any of the following
grounds and no other:
  (1) That the commission acted without or in excess of its
powers;
  (2) That the award was procured by fraud;
  (3) That the facts found by the commission do not support
the award;
  (4) That there was not sufficient competent evidence in the
record to warrant the making of the award.
  2. Appeals from the circuit court shall be allowed in the
same manner as in civil actions, except that the original
transcript prepared and filed in the circuit court by the
commission, together with a transcript of the proceedings had in
the circuit court, shall constitute the transcript on appeal in
the appellate court. The commission shall make available, to the
parties, copies of any transcript prepared and filed by it in the
circuit court and upon final determination of the cause in the
appellate court the original record of the commission filed as a
part of the transcript on appeal shall be certified back to the
commission by the appellate court. In all appeals from the
commission or circuit court the costs thereof shall be assessed
against the losing party as provided by law in civil cases. All
appeals to the circuit and appellate courts shall have precedence
over all cases except election contests.
  3. The provisions of this section shall only apply to
disputes based on claims which arose prior to August 13, 1980.
All disputes based on claims arising on or after August 13, 1980,
shall be governed by the provisions of section 287.495.    Prior revision: 1929 Â§ 3342
    (1960) Where commission affirmed award of referee that
   claimant had not sustained accidental injury and claimant appealed
   to circuit court and procured the judgment he sought,
   namely remand of the claim with directions to dismiss for
   want of jurisdiction because of no accident, the employer and
   insurer were thereby "aggrieved" within meaning of Â§
   512.020 but on the record the appellate court would not review
   question of whether an accident existed. Harger v. Acme
   Fast Freight Inc. (Mo.), 336 S.W.2d 109.
    (1963) Industrial commission was not required to set out specific
   findings of facts as to each individual injury and the resultant
   percent of disability attributed to each, and ultimate
   findings of commission that claimant sustained 40% permanent
   partial disability to body as a whole was sufficient and
   award was properly based thereon. Carenza v. Vulcan-Cincinnati,
   Inc. (A.), 368 S.W.2d 507.
    (1963) Workmen's compensation commission had implied authority
   to enter order vacating award prior to expiration of
   thirty-day appeal period. Fisher v. City of Independence
   (Mo.), 370 S.W.2d 310.
    (1963) Commission's finding that janitor's activity amounted
   to "an unusual or abnormal strain" which constituted an accident
   because he exerted himself beyond his usual routine in
   clearing snow from extensive area of employer's sidewalk was
   a legal conclusion and, therefore, award was subject to review.
   Flippin v. First National Bank of Joplin (A.), 372 S.W.2d
   273.
    (1965) Finding of fact held sufficient to sustain order denying
   compensation. Dixon v. Art Bunker Motors, Inc. (A.), 387
   S.W.2d 199.
    (1965) In workmen's compensation case the reviewing court
   cannot substitute its own judgment on the evidence for that of
   the industrial commission, but is empowered to determine
   whether the award of the commission is supported by competent
   and substantial evidence on the whole record. Jacobs v.
   Eldridge Construction Co. (A.), 393 S.W.2d 33.
    (1967) Decisions of the industrial commission which are
   clearly the interpretation or application of law, rather than a
   determination of facts, are not binding upon appeals court.

    (1967) Where there is no material conflict in, or dispute concerning,
   the facts bearing upon a claimant's status as an employee
   vel non, the resolution of that issue becomes a question
   of law and the industrial commission's determination is not
   binding on the reviewing court. Lawson v. Lawson (A.), 415
   S.W.2d 313.
    (1969) Decisions of the industrial commission which are
   clearly the interpretations or applications of the law, as
   distinguished from a determination of facts, are not binding upon
   the court and are within the province of review and correction.
   Weilert v. Fruin-Colnon Corp. (A.), 447 S.W.2d 781.
    (1970) Notice of Appeal to Industrial Commission affirmation
   of a Workman's Compensation Award must be received
   within 30 days. Holmes v. Navajo Freight Lines, Inc. (A.),
   488 S.W.2d 311.
    (1971) The findings of a referee are not binding on the commission
   but a reviewing court must affirm an award by the
   commission if it is supported by competent and substantial evidence
   on the whole record thus though the evidence was conflicting
   and some of claimant's testimony was contradictory,
   but not to sufficient degree to destroy essential elements of his
   case, the court affirmed the award. Deatherage v. Churchill
   Truck Lines, Inc. (A.), 469 S.W.2d 660.
    (1975) "Last known address" is that place where mail would
   be most likely to reach a person, that would be their residence.

   cannot simply agree with a dissenting member of the
   commission that the evidence was not believable. Johnson v.

  287.495. 1. The final award of the commission shall be conclusive
and binding unless either party to the dispute shall, within thirty days
from the date of the final award, appeal the award to the appellate court.
The appellate court shall have jurisdiction to review all decisions of the
commission pursuant to this chapter where the division has original
jurisdiction over the case. Venue as established by subsection 2 of
section 287.640 shall determine the appellate court which hears the appeal.
Such appeal may be taken by filing notice of appeal with the commission,
whereupon the commission shall, under its certificate, return to the court
all documents and papers on file in the matter, together with a transcript
of the evidence, the findings and award, which shall thereupon become the
record of the cause. Upon appeal no additional evidence shall be heard
and, in the absence of fraud, the findings of fact made by the commission
within its powers shall be conclusive and binding. The court, on appeal,
shall review only questions of law and may modify, reverse, remand for
rehearing, or set aside the award upon any of the following grounds and no
other:
  (1) That the commission acted without or in excess of its powers;
  (2) That the award was procured by fraud;
  (3) That the facts found by the commission do not support the award;
  (4) That there was not sufficient competent evidence in the record to
warrant the making of the award.

Circuit court may act upon memorandum--procedure.
  287.500. Any party in interest may file in the circuit court
of the county in which the accident occurred, a certified copy of
a memorandum of agreement approved by the division or by the
commission or of an order or decision of the division or the
commission, or of an award of the division or of the commission
from which an application for review or from which an appeal has
not been taken, whereupon said court shall render judgment in
accordance therewith and notify the parties. Such judgment shall
have the same effect and all proceedings in relation thereto
shall thereafter be the same as though said judgment were a final
judgment which had been rendered in a suit duly heard and
determined by said court. Any such judgment of said circuit
court unappealed from or affirmed on appeal or modified in
obedience to the mandate of the appellate court, whenever
modified on account of a changed condition under section 287.470,
shall be modified to conform to any decision of the commission,
ending, diminishing or increasing any weekly payment under the

of the case, and the same may be kept open until a final award can be made,
and if the same be not complied with, the amount equal to the value of

final award shall be in accordance with the temporary or partial award.    Prior revision: 1929 Â§ 3344
    (1953) Contention that temporary award could be doubled on
   final award only where defense is found frivolous or vexatious

   thereafter. Finn v. Harrison (A.), 255 S.W.2d 93.
    (1953) This section vests discretion in the commission to determine
   whether an award should be doubled, and its determination
   therein is not to be disturbed unless commission acted
   arbitrarily or abused discretion. Powers v. Universal Atlas Cement

deemed to have been properly given and served when sent by
registered or certified mail properly stamped and addressed to
the person or entity to whom given, at the last known address in
time to reach the person or entity in due time to act thereon, or
to counsel for that person or entity in like manner. Notice may
also be given and served in like manner as summons in civil

--->missouri--->Missouri Statutes--->287.530. Commission or division may commute compensation, when and how.
===================================================================



 

Commission or division may commute compensation, when and how.
  287.530. 1. The compensation provided in this chapter may be
commuted by the division or the commission and redeemed by the payment in
whole or in part, by the employer, of a lump sum which shall be fixed by
the division or the commission, which sum shall be equal to the commutable
value of the future installments which may be due under this chapter,
taking account of life contingencies, the payment to be commuted at its
present value upon application of either party, with due notice to the
other, if it appears that the commutation will be for the best interests of
the employee or the dependents of the deceased employee, or that it will
avoid undue expense or undue hardship to either party, or that the employee
or dependent has removed or is about to remove from the United States or
that the employer has sold or otherwise disposed of the greater part of his
business or assets.
  2. In determining whether the commutation asked for will be for the
best interest of the employee or the dependents of the deceased employee,
or so that it will avoid undue expense or undue hardship to either party,
the division or the commission will constantly bear in mind that it is the
intention of this chapter that the compensation payments are in lieu of
wages and are to be received by the injured employee or his dependents in
the same manner in which wages are ordinarily paid. Therefore, commutation
is a departure from the normal method of payment and is to be allowed only
when it clearly appears that some unusual circumstances warrant such a
departure.    Prior revision: 1929 Â§ 3346

cases, but the same shall not be allowed as costs to the party in
whose behalf the witness was summoned unless the persons before
whom the hearing is had shall certify that the testimony of the
witness was necessary. All costs under this section shall be
approved by the division and paid out of the state treasury from
the fund for the support of the Missouri division of workers'
compensation; provided, however, that if the division or the
commission determines that any proceedings have been brought,
prosecuted or defended without reasonable ground, it may assess
the whole cost of the proceedings upon the party who so brought,
prosecuted or defended them. The division or the commission may
permit a claimant to prosecute a claim as a poor person as
provided by law in civil cases.    Prior revision: 1929 Â§ 3350

country, the state of Missouri, including any of its departments, divisions,
agencies, commissions, and boards or any political subdivisions of the state
who self-insure or hold themselves out to be any part self-insured, company,
mutual company, the parties to any interindemnity contract, or other plan or
scheme, and every other insurance carrier, insuring employers in this state
against liability for personal injuries to their employees, or for death
caused thereby, under this chapter, shall pay, as provided in this chapter,
tax upon the net deposits, net premiums or net assessments received, whether

registration as taken from premium rates filed by the twenty insurance
companies providing the greatest volume of workers' compensation insurance
coverage in this state. For employers qualified to self-insure their
liability pursuant to this chapter, the rates filed by such group of employers
in accordance with subsection 2 of section 287.280 shall be the net premium
equivalent. Every entity required to pay the tax imposed pursuant to this
section and section 287.730 shall be notified by the division of workers'
compensation within ten calendar days of the date of the determination of the

  287.710. 1. Every such insurance carrier or self-insurer, on or before
the first day of March of each year, shall make a return, verified by the
affidavit of its president and secretary or other chief officers or agents, to
the director of the department of insurance, financial institutions and
professional registration, stating the amount of all such gross premiums or
deposits and credits during the year ending on the thirty-first day of
December, next preceding.
  2. The amount of the tax due for each calendar year shall be paid in
four approximately equal estimated quarterly installments, and a fifth
reconciling installment. The first four installments shall be based upon the
application of the current calendar year's tax rate to the premium for the
immediately preceding taxable year ending on the thirty-first day of December,
next preceding. The quarterly installments shall be made on the first day of
March, the first day of June, the first day of September and the first day of
December. Immediately after receiving certification from the director of the
department of insurance, financial institutions and professional registration
of the amount of tax due from the various companies or self-insurers, the
director of revenue shall notify and assess each company or self-insurer the
amount of taxes on its premiums for the calendar year ending on the
thirty-first day of December, next preceding. The director of revenue shall

due is less than the total amount of the installments actually paid, the
amount by which the amount paid exceeds the amount due shall be credited
against the tax for the following year and deducted from the quarterly
installment otherwise due on the first day of June. If the March first
quarterly installment made by a company or self-insurer is less than the
amount assessed by the director of revenue, the difference will be due on June
first, but no interest will accrue to the state on the difference unless the
amount paid by the company or self-insurer is less than eighty percent of
one-fourth of the total amount of tax assessed by the director of revenue for
the immediately preceding taxable year.
  3. Upon the receipt of the returns and verification by the director of
the division of workers' compensation as to the percent of tax to be imposed,
the director of the department of insurance, financial institutions and
professional registration shall certify the amount of tax due from the various

compensation on or before the thirtieth day of April of each year. If the
taxes provided for in this section are not paid, the department of revenue
shall certify the fact to the director of the department of insurance,
financial institutions and professional registration who shall thereafter
suspend the delinquent carriers of insurance or self-insurers from the further
transaction of business in this state until the taxes are paid.
  4. Upon receipt of the money all such moneys shall be deposited to the
credit of the fund for the support of the division of workers' compensation.
  5. The tax collected for implementing the workers' compensation fund,
and any interest accruing thereon, under the police power of the state from
those specified in sections 287.690, 287.715, and 287.730 shall be used for
the purpose of making effective the law to relieve victims of industrial
injuries from having individually to bear the burden of misfortune or becoming
charges upon society and for the further purpose of providing for the physical
rehabilitation of the victims of industrial injuries, and for no other
purposes. It is hereby made the express duty of every person exercising any
official authority or responsibility in and for the state of Missouri sacredly
to safeguard and preserve all funds collected, and any interest accruing
thereon, under and by virtue of sections 287.690, 287.715, and 287.730 for the
purposes hereinabove declared.
  6. The funds created by virtue of sections 287.220, 287.690, 287.715,

of age or older, who has served or who has creditable service in this state
for an aggregate of at least twelve years, or any person, sixty years of
age or older, who has served or who has creditable service in this state
for an aggregate of at least fifteen years or any person, fifty-five years
of age or older, who has served or who has creditable service in this state
for an aggregate of twenty years, continuously or otherwise, as an

expiration of his or her term, voluntary resignation, retirement pursuant
to the provisions of sections 287.812 to 287.856, or removal by the
governor for any nondisciplinary reason, shall receive benefits as provided
in sections 287.812 to 287.856. The twelve years', fifteen years' or
twenty years' requirement of this section may be fulfilled by service as an
administrative law judge or legal advisor, or both, of the division at any
time prior to or after August 13, 1984. If a person appointed pursuant to
section 286.010, RSMo, or a chairman appointed pursuant to section 295.030,
RSMo, does not have twelve years' or fifteen years' service, as required
pursuant to this subsection, as an administrative law judge or legal
advisor, or both, but the person has served in the general assembly, each
biennial assembly or partial biennial assembly either served or purchased
shall be deemed and credited as two full years of creditable service as an
administrative law judge or legal advisor if the person waives in writing
all right to any other retirement benefit provided by his or her service as
a member of the general assembly.
  2. Any aggregate of twelve years or more of such service shall
entitle the person to retirement benefits provided in sections 287.812 to
287.856 regardless of whether or not the person was so employed upon
reaching the age of eligibility as described in subsection 1 of this
section. However, the retirement benefits shall not be paid to the person
until that person attains the age of eligibility as described in subsection
1 of this section.
  3. If a person appointed pursuant to section 286.010, RSMo, or
pursuant to section 295.030, RSMo, or pursuant to section 621.015, RSMo, or
an attorney or legal counsel appointed or employed pursuant to section
286.070, RSMo, does not have twelve years' service as an administrative law
judge or legal advisor, or both, but the person has creditable service
under the Missouri state employees' retirement system, such person may
elect that such service be credited as service as an administrative law
judge or legal advisor if the person waives in writing all right to any
other retirement benefit provided for other service. Persons appointed
pursuant to section 621.015, RSMo, shall be required to have served a
majority of a term in order to qualify for benefits pursuant to sections
287.812 to 287.856.
  4. Any person who has been appointed and has served pursuant to
section 621.015, RSMo, prior to August 28, 1999, who is receiving or
thereafter is qualified to receive retirement benefits pursuant to section

employed by the board of trustees of the Missouri state employees'
retirement system as a special consultant on the problems of retirement,
aging and other state matters for the remainder of the person's life. Upon
request of the board or the administrative hearing commission, the
consultant shall give opinions or be available to give opinions in writing
or orally in response to such requests. As compensation for such services
and in lieu of receiving benefits pursuant to section 104.374, RSMo, each
such special consultant shall be eligible for all benefits payable pursuant
to sections 287.812 to 287.856, effective upon the later of August 28,
1999, or the date retirement benefits become payable. In no event shall
retroactive benefits be paid.    (2008) Retroactive application of amended section reducing age of
   eligibility from sixty-five to sixty-two to previously retired
   administrative law judge violates Article III, sections 38(a) and

withhold and pay on the retired member's behalf to the proper person, from
each of the retired member's monthly retirement benefit payments, if the
payment is large enough, the contribution due from the retired member to
any group providing prepaid hospital care and any group providing prepaid

each year computed upon the total amount that the consultant received in
the previous year from state retirement benefits of eighty percent of the
increase in the consumer price index calculated in the manner specified in

annual benefit increases provided by subsection 4 of this section on or
after October 1, 1996, but before September 1, 1997, shall receive the
benefit increase described in this subsection beginning on the anniversary
date of the special consultant's retirement following September 1, 1997.
In no event shall any retroactive annual benefit increases be paid under
this subsection to any special consultant who reached the limit provided in
subsection 4 of this section prior to August 28, 1997.
  6. Each person who is employed for the first time as an
administrative law judge or a legal advisor on or after August 28, 1997,
and retires shall be entitled annually to a percentage increase in the

service equivalent to such service in the armed forces, but not to exceed

appropriate documentation verifying the member's dates of active service
and by paying to the Missouri state employees' retirement system an amount
equal to what would have been contributed by the state on the member's
behalf had he been a member for the period for which the member is electing
to purchase credit and had the member's compensation during such period of
membership been the same as the annual salary rate at which the member was
initially employed by a department, with the calculations based on the
contribution rate in effect on the date of employment as an administrative
law judge or legal advisor with simple interest at the same rate in effect
at the time of election used by the Missouri state employees' retirement
system calculated from the date of such employment from which the member
could first receive creditable service to the date of election under this

surviving spouse is not entitled to a survivorship benefit payable under

===================================================================



 

Guaranty association, created, all self-insured to be
members--powers--withdrawing member, duties.
  287.860. 1. There is hereby created a not-for-profit corporation to be
known as the "Missouri Private Sector Individual Self-Insurers Guaranty
Corporation", hereinafter referred to as "the corporation" whose domicile and
venue for service shall be Cole County, Missouri. Upon incorporation and
adoption of bylaws, all individual self-insurers, as defined in section
287.280, other than individual public sector self-insurers and individual and
public group self-insurers, as defined in section 287.280 and section 537.620,
RSMo, shall be and remain members of the corporation as a condition of their
authority to individually self-insure in this state. The corporation shall
perform its functions under a plan of operation as established and approved in
section 287.870 and shall exercise its powers and duties through a board of
directors as established in section 287.862. The corporation shall have those
powers granted or permitted general not-for-profit corporations, as provided
for in chapter 355, RSMo.
  2. A member may voluntarily withdraw from the corporation when the
member voluntarily terminates the self-insurance privilege and pays all
assessments due to the date of such termination. However, the withdrawing
member shall continue to be bound by the provisions of sections 287.860 to
287.885 relating to the period of its membership and any claims charged
pursuant thereto. The withdrawing member, who is or shall become a member on
or after the incorporation, shall also be required to provide to the division
of workers' compensation, hereinafter referred to as "the division" upon
withdrawal, and at twelve-month intervals thereafter, satisfactory proof that
it continues to meet the standards of section 287.280 or the rules promulgated
by the division under chapter 287 in relation to claims incurred while the
withdrawing member exercised the privilege of self-insurance. Such reporting
shall continue until the withdrawing member satisfies the division that there
is no remaining value to claims incurred while the withdrawing member was
self-insured. If, during this reporting period, the withdrawing member fails
to meet the standards of section 287.280 or the rules promulgated by the
division under chapter 287, the withdrawing member who is a member on or after
the incorporation, may at six-month intervals or other agreed upon intervals
thereafter be required by the division or by the corporation to provide to the
division and to the corporation the certified opinion of an independent
actuary who is a member of the American Society of Actuaries of the actuarial
present value of the determined and estimated future compensation payments of
the members for claims incurred while the member was a self-insurer. With
each such opinion, the withdrawing member shall deposit with the division
security in an amount equal to the value certified by the actuary and of a
type that is acceptable for qualifying security deposits under section
287.280. The withdrawing member shall continue to provide such opinions and
to provide such security until such time as the latest opinion shows no
remaining value of claims. The corporation has a cause of action against a
withdrawing member, and against any successor of a withdrawing member, who
fails to timely provide the required opinion or who fails to maintain the
required deposit with the division. The corporation shall be entitled to
recover a judgment in the amount of the actuarial present value of the
determined and estimated future compensation payments of the withdrawing
member for claims incurred during the time that the withdrawing member
exercised the privilege of self-insurance, together with reasonable attorney's
fees and all costs pertaining thereto. For purposes of sections 287.860 to
287.885, the "successor of a withdrawing member" means any person, business

  3. Two of such board members shall serve for two-year
terms, ending no later than January 1, 1995, and three of such

===================================================================



 

Moneys not deemed state moneys--use of funds--reports to director,
when--additional powers of corporation--assessments, division shall
levy, amount--no dividends to be paid--bankruptcy, dissolution,
or insolvency of self-insured member, procedure.
  287.865. 1. Moneys collected by or on behalf of the division of
workers' compensation and dispersed to the corporation shall be vested in the
corporation and shall not thereafter be deemed state property and shall not
thereafter be subject to appropriation by the legislature, the treasurer, or
any other state agency.
  2. All moneys in the insolvency fund, exclusive of administrative costs
reasonably necessary to conduct the business of the corporation, as determined
at the discretion of the board, as described in section 287.867, shall be used
solely to compensate persons entitled to receive workers' compensation
benefits from a Missouri self-insurer which is unable to meet its workers'
compensation benefit obligations and to defray the expenses of the fund.
  3. The board of directors of the corporation shall direct the investment
of the moneys in the fund, and all returns on the investments shall be
retained in the fund. The corporation shall, at the request of the director
of the division, annually submit to an audit by an independent certified
public accountant or by such other person or persons as the director deems
sufficient, and a copy of the audit report shall be transmitted to the
Missouri division of workers' compensation and to the corporation.
  4. The board of directors of the corporation shall, based on such
information as is reasonably available, report to the director of the division
upon all matters germane to the solvency, liquidation, rehabilitation or
conservation of any workers' compensation self-insurer and such reports shall
not be deemed public documents under the provisions of section 610.010, RSMo,
or any other law.
  5. Upon creation of the insolvency fund pursuant to the provisions of
section 287.867, the corporation is obligated for payment of compensation
under this chapter to insolvent members' employees resulting from incidents
and injuries to the extent of covered claims existing prior to the issuance of
an order of liquidation against the member employer with a finding of
insolvency which has been entered by a court of competent jurisdiction in the
member employer's state of domicile or of this state under the provisions of
sections 375.950 to 375.990, RSMo, in which the order of liquidation has not
been stayed or been the subject of a writ of supersedeas or other comparable
order; or prior to the date of determination by the board of directors that
the member employer has fully expended all surety bonds, insurance or
reinsurance, and all other available assets and is not able to pay
compensation benefits at that time. All incidents giving rise to claims for
compensation under this chapter must occur during the year in which such
insolvent member is a member of the guaranty fund and was assessable pursuant
to the plan of operation, except as provided for certain claims existing prior
to August 28, 1992, pursuant to the provisions of subsection 7 of this
section, and the employee must make timely claim for such payments according
to procedures set forth by a court of competent jurisdiction over the
delinquency or bankruptcy proceedings of the insolvent member. Any proceeds
derived by such claim of the employee in bankruptcy shall be an offset of any
amounts due and owing to the employee under the workers' compensation law.
Any such obligation of the corporation includes only the amount due the
injured worker or workers of the insolvent member under this chapter. In no
event is the corporation obligated to a claimant in an amount in excess of the
obligation of the insolvent member employer. The corporation shall be deemed
the insolvent employer for purposes of this chapter to the extent of its
obligation on the covered claims and, to such extent, shall have all the
rights, duties, and obligations of the insolvent employer as if the employer
had not become insolvent. However, in no event shall the corporation be
liable for any penalties or interest. The division, upon notice of a
self-insured member filing bankruptcy, liquidation, or dissolution, shall
notify in writing any employee of the self-insured member, who has an open
claim for compensation or first report of injury filed with the division, at
that employee's last known address of his or her obligation to file a proof of
claim with the court of jurisdiction and of the need of the employee to
provide the guaranty fund and the division with the records set out in this
section. Any claimant claiming benefits under this chapter against an
insolvent self-insured member of the Missouri Private Sector and Individual
Guaranty Corporation shall, before the division of workers' compensation for
the state of Missouri attaches jurisdiction, file with the bankruptcy court
having jurisdiction over the bankruptcy of the self-insured employer, a proof
of claim or other claim forms required by the appropriate bankruptcy court to
secure a claim against the bankrupt employer. Any such claimant shall provide
to the Missouri private sector self-insurance guaranty corporation and to the
division of workers' compensation a copy, certified by the bankruptcy court,
attesting to the filing of such claim or claim forms. Certification shall
include the date of alleged loss alleged against the bankrupt employer;
description of injuries claimed; and date the claim or claims were filed with
the bankruptcy court. Failure of the claimant to provide such information
shall bar the division from invoking jurisdiction over any matter for which an
employee may otherwise be entitled to benefits under this chapter.
  6. The corporation may:
  (1) Request that the director revoke any member employer's authority to
act as a qualified private sector individual self-insurer if the self-insurer
member fails to maintain membership in the corporation or fails to pay the
assessments levied by the division under sections 287.860 to 287.885;
  (2) Sue or be sued, including appearing in, prosecuting or defending and
appealing any action on a claim brought by or against the corporation. The
corporation shall have full rights of subrogation against any source of
payment or reimbursement for payments by the corporation on behalf of a
Missouri workers' compensation self-insurer. The corporation shall have a
right of recovery through the maintenance of an action against any third
party, other than a coemployee, who is in any way responsible or liable for
injury or death to a covered worker. The corporation is also authorized to
take all necessary action, including bringing an action at law or in equity to
seek any available relief, including any action against any workers'
compensation self-insurer, where the self-insurer has not paid all assessments
levied by the division or the board of directors of the corporation. If the
corporation is required to bring an action at law or in equity to enforce any
obligations, rights or duties as regards a workers' compensation self-insurer,
the court may award reasonable attorney's fees and costs to the corporation;
  (3) Employ or retain such persons, including utilization of an in-house
or a third-party administrator, fund manager, attorney, certified public
accountant, auditor or other such person, and sufficient clerical staff,
experts, professional staff and equipment, including sharing clerical staff
and other costs with the division upon a mutually agreed upon paid basis, as
are necessary to handle the claims and perform other duties of the
corporation;
  (4) Borrow funds, including authority to issue bonds or purchase excess
or any appropriate insurance or reinsurance, necessary to effectuate the
purposes of sections 287.860 to 287.885 or to protect the assets of this fund
and the members of the board and their employees in accordance with the plan
of operation;
  (5) Negotiate and become a party to such contracts and perform such
other acts as are necessary or proper to effectuate the purpose of sections
287.860 to 287.885;
  (6) Become members of any trade association whose purpose includes
furthering the understanding of the self-insurance industry in the state of
Missouri, including the National Council of Self-Insurers, or other
appropriate state, regional or national organizations;
  (7) Review, on its own motion, or at the request of the director, all
applications for initial and for membership renewal in the corporation,
including financial or other appropriate background studies, actuarial
studies, and other information or guidelines as may be necessary to ensure
that the member is fully complying with the privileges of self-insurance. It
shall be the primary duty of the division to provide adequate staff and
equipment and technical assistance to thoroughly review initial applications
and membership renewals through budgeted funds and initial applications and
membership renewal application fees. The corporation, however, shall have the
right to, in difficult cases or situations where the work load cannot be
adequately done without the help of the corporation, to assist in any
assessment of any applicant;
  (8) Issue opinions prior to a final determination by the division of
workers' compensation as to whether or not to approve any applicant for
membership in the corporation, to the division concerning any applicant, which
opinions shall be considered by the division;
  (9) Charge an applicant, in addition to the applicant's assessment, for
initial or membership renewal in the corporation, a fee sufficient to cover
the actual cost of examining the financial and safety conditions of the
applicant.
  7. To the extent necessary to secure funds for the payment of covered
claims and also to pay the reasonable costs to administer them, the division,
upon certification of the board of directors, shall levy assessments based on
the annual modified standard premium, provided that no such assessments shall
ever exceed, in the aggregate, from all members, an amount in excess of one
million dollars at any given time, exclusive of all new members' assessments
in the amounts collected for same, as is set forth in the plan of operation
pursuant to the provisions of section 287.870. Such assessments shall be made
at a maximum annual assessment of one-sixth of one percent of the annual
modified standard premium. The initial assessment shall be for an amount
equal to six hundred thousand dollars, the amount of such fee to be levied
over a three-year period, one-third of the six hundred thousand dollars to be
collected and received the first year, one-third to be collected and received
in the second year, and one-third to be collected and received in the third
year, the first year to commence as of the date of incorporation, assessments
to be prorated on an annualized basis. The director of the division shall
annually certify to the corporation the assessment percentage due from the
members of the corporation. The director of the division and the board of the
corporation shall within the procedures as specified in this section and as
established for the premium tax billings, as provided in sections 287.690,
287.710, 287.715 and 287.730, notify, assess, and receive the assessments due
from those members for the prior calendar year ending on the thirty-first day
of December, with the exception that this annual assessment shall be payable
in full on or before the first day of March directly to the corporation. The
department of insurance, financial institutions and professional registration
shall make available to the corporation or director of the division data on
the self-insured employer's workers' compensation administrative tax data for
use in verification of the assessment as provided in this section. If
assessments provided in this section are not paid, the corporation shall
certify the fact to the division. Out of the first amounts assessed, there
shall be set aside an amount equal to fifty thousand dollars, which shall be
applied retroactively, before August 28, 1992, to be used and applied for the
benefit of employees who have open, outstanding claims, in existence, which
have not already been fully and completely settled or for which there has been
an award of judgment rendered, and for which there are moneys due and owing.
The amount of payment and allocation of funds shall be within the exclusive
discretion of the director, such payments to be made on a reasonably timely
basis, as the director received funds for such purpose. In addition, there
shall be no reassessments against any member unless the director feels the
current balance of the fund is insufficient or, after deducting the amount
paid for or reserved for outstanding claims and for administrative and other
costs in managing the corporation, the amount held shall be less than four
hundred thousand dollars, at which point the director shall raise assessments
sufficient to bring the minimum amount of the fund back up to six hundred
thousand dollars or such other amount not to exceed, in any event, one million
dollars based upon a maximum annual assessment of one-sixth of one percent of
the annual modified standard premium as shall be necessary to effectuate the
purposes of the corporation at that time.
  8. Every assessment shall be made on a uniform percentage of the figure
applicable, provided that the assessment levied against any self-insurer in
any one year shall not exceed one-sixth of one percent of the annual modified
standard premium during the calendar year preceding the date of the
assessment. Assessments shall be remitted to and administered by the board of
directors in the manner specified by the approved plan. Each employer so
assessed shall have at least thirty days' written notice as to the date the
assessment is due and payable. The corporation shall levy assessments against
any newly admitted member of the corporation on the basis of contribution
under the plan of operation as provided in section 287.870 and the applicable
rules and regulations established pursuant thereto.
  9. If, in any one year, funds available from such assessments, together
with funds previously raised, are not sufficient to make all the payments or
reimbursements then owing, the funds available shall be prorated, and the
unpaid portion shall be paid as soon thereafter as sufficient additional funds
become available.
  10. No state funds of any kind shall be allocated or paid to the
corporation or any of its accounts except those state funds accruing to the
corporation by and through the assignment of rights of any insolvent employer.
  11. All moneys, property and other assets received, owned or otherwise
held by the corporation shall be held in such a way as to safeguard the
corporation's ability to assure that the purpose and objectives of the
corporation shall be advanced and that moneys needed to pay claims to
employees of an individual insolvent self-insurer in the private sector shall
be preserved.
  12. Income derived from the corporation assets and investments shall
vest in the corporation and shall not inure, under any circumstances, to the
benefit of any member, the division of workers' compensation or any of its
employees, or any other party other than an employee. The corporation may
reinvest that income as otherwise provided for investing corporation assets.
All such investments of corporation income shall be made in such a way as to
ensure the welfare of the employees of the private sector individual
self-insurers that are financially unable to meet their workers' compensation
benefit obligations. In the event that the corporation shall be dissolved,
any surplus income previously held by the insolvency fund shall be held in
trust for the benefit of the employees of insolvent private sector individual
self-insurers in the state of Missouri.
  13. The corporation and the insolvency fund shall pay no dividends,
rebates, interest, or otherwise distribute any corporation or fund income to
any of its members.    (L. 1992 H.B. 975, A.L. 1993 S.B. 251, A.L. 2005 S.B. 1 & 130)

and shall authorize the board of directors to contract and employ

stated purpose.
  3. The plan of operation, and any amendments thereto, shall

===================================================================



 

Powers and duties of division.
  287.872. 1. The division shall:
  (1) Notify the corporation of the existence of an insolvent
employer within a reasonable period of time, but not later, in
any event, than ten working days after it receives notice of the
determination of insolvency;
  (2) Upon request of the board of directors, provide the
corporation with a statement of the annual modified standard
premiums of each member employer;
  (3) Set up procedures to ensure the cooperation of the
director and employees of the division with the board and
individual self-insurers acting under this section wherever
possible.
  2. The division may:
  (1) Require that the corporation notify the member
employers and any other interested parties of the determination
of insolvency and of their rights under sections 287.860 to
287.885. Such notification shall be by mail to the last known
address thereof when available; but, if sufficient information
for notification by mail is not available, notice by publication
in a newspaper of general circulation in accordance with the
applicable law pertaining to same shall be sufficient;
  (2) Suspend or revoke the authority of any member employer
failing to pay an assessment when due or failing to comply with
the plan of operation to self-insure in this state. As an
alternative, the division may levy a penalty on any member
employer failing to pay an assessment when due. Such penalty
shall not exceed five percent of the unpaid assessment per month;
  (3) Revoke the designation of any servicing facility,
including third-party administrators, if the division, in

Assignment of recovery rights to corporation, when--receiver or
liquidator, rights--corporation to file statements with receiver,

  287.875. 1. Any person who recovers from the corporation
under sections 287.860 to 287.885 shall be deemed to have
assigned her or his rights to the corporation to the extent of
such recovery. Every claimant seeking the protection of sections
287.860 to 287.885 shall cooperate with the corporation to the
same extent as such person would have been required to cooperate
with the insolvent member employer. The corporation shall have
no cause of action against the employee of the insolvent member
employer for any sums the corporation has paid out, except such
causes of action as the insolvent member employer would have had
if such sums had been paid by the insolvent member employer. In
the case of an insolvent member employer operating on a plan with
assessment liability, payments of claims by the corporation shall
not operate to reduce the liability of the insolvent member
employer to the receiver, liquidator, or statutory successor for
unpaid assessments.
  2. The receiver, liquidator, or statutory successor of an
insolvent member employer shall be bound by settlements of
covered claims by the corporation. The court having jurisdiction
shall grant such claims priority against the assets of the
insolvent member employer equal to that to which the claimant
would have been entitled in the absence of sections 287.860 to
287.885. The expense of the corporation or similar organization
in handling claims shall be accorded the same priority as the
expenses of the liquidator.
  3. The corporation shall file periodically with the
receiver or liquidator of the insolvent member employer
statements of the covered claims paid by the corporation and
estimates of anticipated claims on the corporation, which shall
preserve the rights of the corporation against the assets of the
insolvent member employer.    (L. 1992 H.B. 975)

member employer may be insolvent or in a financial condition
hazardous to the employees thereof or to the public, it shall be
the duty of the board of directors to notify the division of
workers' compensation of any information indicating such
condition.
  2. The board of directors may, upon majority vote, request
that the division determine the condition of any member employer
which the board in good faith believes may no longer be qualified
to be a member of the corporation. Within thirty days of the
receipt of such request or, for good cause shown, within a
reasonable time thereafter, the division shall make such
determination and shall forthwith advise the board of its
findings. Each request for a determination shall be kept on file
by the division, but the request shall not be open to public
inspection prior to the release of the determination to the

be no longer qualified to be a member of the corporation.
  4. The board of directors may, upon majority vote, make
reports and recommendations to the division upon any matter which
is germane to the solvency, liquidation, rehabilitation, or
conservation of any member employer. Such reports and

of workers' compensation, or any of its employees or

any of them in the administration of this workers' compensation
self-insurer's guaranty fund, or in the performance of their

additional period from the date of an order of liquidation
against the member employer with a finding of insolvency, entered
by a court of competent jurisdiction or from the date the board
of directors of the guaranty corporation determines that the
member employer has fully expended all surety bonds, reinsurance,
and all other available assets, and is not able to pay
compensation benefits, as is deemed necessary by a court of
competent jurisdiction to permit proper defense by the
corporation of all pending causes of action as to any covered
claims arising from a judgment under any decision, verdict, or
finding based on the default of the insolvent member employer.
The corporation, either on its own behalf or on behalf of the
insolvent member employer, may apply to have such judgment,
order, decision, verdict, or finding set aside by the same court
or administrator that made such judgment, order, decision,
verdict, or finding and shall be permitted to defend against such
claim on the merits. If requested by the corporation, the stay
of proceedings may be shortened or waived.

Residual market, department to develop plan--insurers to participate,
rates, procedures--duties of director.
  287.896. 1. Within forty-five days of August 28, 1993, the director of
the department of insurance, financial institutions and professional
registration shall approve a plan of operation for a new residual market that
will guarantee insurance coverage and quality loss prevention and control
services for employers seeking coverage through the plan. The new residual
market shall begin operation January 1, 1994.
  2. All insurers authorized to write workers' compensation and employers'
liability insurance shall participate in such plan providing for the equitable
apportionment among them of insurance which may be afforded applicants who are
in good faith entitled to but who are unable to procure such insurance through
ordinary methods, except that all employers that have expiring annual premiums
greater than two hundred fifty thousand dollars must negotiate a retrospective
rating plan with their insurer that is acceptable to the director of the
department of insurance, financial institutions and professional registration.
 The rates, supplementary rate information and policy forms to be used in such
a plan and any future modification thereof must be submitted to the director
for approval at least seventy-five days prior to their effective date. Such
rates shall be set by the director after hearing so that the amount required
in premiums, together with reasonable investment income earned on those
premiums, is not excessive, inadequate or unfairly discriminatory and is
actuarially sufficient to apply claims and losses and reasonable operating
expenses of the insurers. Nothing contained herein shall prevent the director
from including a merit rating plan for nonexperienced rated employers within
the residual market plan. The director shall adopt within the plan a system
to distribute any residual market deficit through an assessment on insurance
carriers authorized to write workers' compensation insurance in proportion to
the respective share of voluntary market premium written by such carrier.
  3. The director shall disapprove any filing that does not meet the
requirements of this section. A filing shall be deemed to meet such
requirements unless approved, disapproved or modified by the director within
seventy-five days after the filing is made. In disapproving a filing made
pursuant to this section, the director shall have the same authority and
follow the same procedures as in disapproving a rate filing pursuant to the
requirements for filings in the voluntary market. The designated advisory
organization may make and file the plan of operation, rates, rating plans,
rules and policy forms under this section.
  4. The director shall establish by rule standards to assure that any
employer insured through the plan shall receive the same quality of service in
the areas of employee classification, safety engineering, loss control, claims
handling and claim reserving practices as do employers which are voluntarily
insured as provided in section 287.123. The standards established by the
director pursuant to this subsection shall also specify the procedures and
grounds under which an employer insured through the plan shall be assigned an
insurer, and the method by which such employers shall be informed of such
procedures and grounds. All insurers of the residual market shall process
applications, conduct safety engineering or other loss control services and
provide claims handling within the state of Missouri or adjoining states.    (L. 1993 S.B. 251 Â§ 14)

Competitive market presumed to exist, when--reasonable degree of
competition, factors.
  287.942. 1. A competitive market is presumed to exist
unless the director, after hearing, determines that a reasonable
degree of competition does not exist in the market and the
director issues an order to that effect. Such an order shall
expire no later than one year after issue. In determining
whether a reasonable degree of competition exists, the director
may consider relevant tests of workable competition pertaining to
market structure, market performance and market conduct. For the
purposes of this section, "market" shall mean the statewide
workers' compensation and employers' liability lines of business.
  2. In determining whether a reasonable degree of
competition exists, the following factors shall be considered:
  (1) Generally accepted and relevant tests of competition
pertaining to market structure, market performance and market
conduct;
  (2) Market concentration as measured by the
Herfindahl-Herschman Index;
  (3) The number of insurers transacting workers'
compensation insurance in the market;
  (4) Insurer market shares and changes in market shares;
  (5) Ease of entry into the market;
  (6) Whether long-term profitability for insurers in the
market is unreasonably high in relation to the risks being
insured; and
  (7) Whether long-term profitability for insurers in the
market is reasonable in relation to industries of comparable
business risk.    Effective 1-1-94

 Director to monitor degree of competition, purpose. 287.945. In determining whether or not a competitive market exists pursuant to section 287.942, the director shall monitor the degree of competition in this state. In doing so, the director shall use existing relevant information, analytical systems and other sources; cause or participate in the development of new relevant information, analytical systems and other sources; or rely on some combination thereof. Such activities may be conducted internally within the department of insurance, financial institutions and professional registration, in cooperation with other state insurance departments, through outside contractors or in any other appropriate manner.

===================================================================



 

Insurers to file rate information in competitive market with the
director, purpose--noncompetitive market, information filed--form of
filing--public inspection.
  287.947. 1. In a competitive market, every insurer shall
file with the director all rates and supplementary rate
information which is to be used in this state, except as provided
in section 287.955. Such rates and supplementary rate
information shall be filed not later than thirty days after the
effective date. If the director finds, after a hearing, that an
insurer's rates require closer supervision because of the
insurer's financial condition or unfairly discriminatory rating
practices, the insurer shall file with the director at least
thirty days before the effective date, all such rates and such
supplementary rate information and supporting information as
prescribed by the director. Upon application by the filer, the
director may authorize an earlier effective date.
  2. In a noncompetitive market every insurer shall file with
the director all rates and supplementary rate information which
is to be used in this state, except as provided in section
287.942. Such rates and supplementary rate information and
supporting information required by the director shall be filed at
least thirty days before the effective date. Upon application by
the filer, the director may authorize an earlier effective date.
  3. Rates filed pursuant to this section shall be filed in
such form and manner as prescribed by the director. In a
noncompetitive market, whenever a filing is not accompanied by
such information as the director has required under this section,
the director shall so inform the insurer within fifteen days and
the filing shall not be deemed to be made until the information
is furnished or the insurer certifies that the additional
information is not maintained or cannot be provided.
  4. All rates, supplementary rate information and any
supporting information for risks filed under sections 287.930 to
287.975 shall, as soon as filed, be open to public inspection at
any reasonable time. Copies may be obtained by any person on
request and upon payment of a reasonable charge.    Effective 1-1-94

--->missouri--->Missouri Statutes--->287.950. Competitive market, rates not to be excessive, inadequate, unfairly discriminatory.
===================================================================



 

Competitive market, rates not to be excessive, inadequate, unfairly
discriminatory.
  287.950. 1. Rates in a competitive market shall not be
excessive, inadequate or unfairly discriminatory. Rates are
excessive if it is likely to produce a long-run profit that is
unreasonably high for the insurance provided or if expenses are
unreasonably high in relation to services rendered. Rates are
not inadequate unless clearly insufficient to sustain projected
losses and expenses and the use of such rates, if continued, will
tend to create a monopoly in the market. A rate is inadequate if
funds equal to the full ultimate cost of anticipated losses and
loss adjustment expenses are not produced when the prospective
loss costs are applied to anticipated payrolls.
  2. Unfair discrimination exists if, after allowing for
practical limitations, price differentials fail to reflect
equitably the differences in expected losses and expenses. A
rate is not unfairly discriminatory because different premiums
result for policyholders with like loss exposures but different
expenses, or like expenses but different loss exposures, so long
as the rate reflects the differences with reasonable accuracy.    Effective 1-1-94

Rate standards in noncompetitive market, factors.
  287.952. In determining whether rates comply with the
excessiveness standard in a noncompetitive market, the inadequacy
standard and the unfair discrimination standard, the following
criteria shall apply:
  (1) Due consideration may be given to past and prospective
loss and expense experience within and outside of this state, to
catastrophe hazards and contingencies, to events or trends within
and outside of this state, to loadings for leveling premium rates
over time, for dividends or savings to be allowed or returned by
insurers to their policyholders, members or subscribers, and to
all other relevant factors, including judgment;
  (2) The expense provisions included in the rates to be used
by an insurer shall reflect the operating methods of the insurer
and, so far as it is credible, its own actual and anticipated
expense experience;
  (3) The rates may contain provisions for contingencies and
an allowance permitting a reasonable profit. In determining the
reasonableness of profit, consideration should be given to all
investment income attributable to premiums and the reserves
associated with those premiums.    Effective 1-1-94

1. Every workers' compensation insurer shall adhere to auniform classification system and uniform experience rating planfiled with the director by the advisory organization designated bythe director and subject to his disapproval.2. An insurer may develop subclassifications of the uniformclassification system upon which a rate may be made, except that suchsubclassifications shall be filed with the director thirty days priorto their use. The director shall disapprove subclassifications if theinsurer fails to demonstrate that the data thereby produced can bereported consistent with the uniform statistical plan andclassification system.3. The director shall designate an advisory organization to assisthim in gathering, compiling and reporting relevant statisticalinformation. Every workers' compensation insurer shall record andreport its workers' compensation experience to the designatedadvisory organization as set forth in the uniform statistical planapproved by the director.4. The designated advisory organization shall develop and filemanual rules, subject to the approval of the director, reasonablyrelated to the recording and reporting of data pursuant to theuniform statistical plan, uniform experience rating plan, and theuniform classification system.5. Every workers' compensation insurer shall adhere to the approvedmanual rules and experience rating plan in writing and reporting itsbusiness. No insurer shall agree with any other insurer or with theadvisory organization to adhere to manual rules which are notreasonably related to the recording and reporting of data pursuant tothe uniform classification system of the uniform statistical plan.6. (1) A workers' compensation insurer may develop an individualrisk premium modification rating plan which prospectively modifiespremium based upon individual risk characteristics which arepredictive of future loss. Such rating plan shall be filed thirtydays prior to use and may be subject to disapproval by the director.(2) The rating plan shall establish objective standards formeasuring variations in individual risks for hazards or expense orboth. The rating plan shall be actuarially justified and shall notresult in premiums which are excessive, inadequate, or unfairlydiscriminatory. The rating plan shall not utilize factors which areduplicative of factors otherwise utilized in the development of ratesor premiums, including the uniform classification system and theuniform experience rating plan. The premium modification factorsutilized under the rating plan shall be applied on a statewide basis,with no premium modifications based solely upon the geographiclocation of the employer.(3) Within thirty days of a request, the insurer shall clearlydisclose to the employer the individual risk characteristics whichresult in premium modifications. However, this disclosure shall notin any way require the release to the insured employer of any tradesecret or proprietary information or data used to derive the premiummodification and that meets the definitions of, and is protected by,the provisions of chapter 417.(4) (a) Premium modifications under this subsection may bedetermined by an underwriter assessing the individual riskcharacteristics and applying premium credits and debits as specifiedunder a schedule rating plan. Alternatively, an insurer may utilizesoftware or a computer risk modeling system designed to identify andassess individual risk characteristics and which systematically anduniformly applies premium modifications to similarly situatedemployers.(b) Premium modifications resulting from a schedule rating plan,with an underwriter determining individual risk characteristics,shall be limited to plus or minus twenty-five percent. An additionalten percent credit may be given for a reduction in the insurer'sexpenses.(c) Premium modifications resulting from a risk modeling systemshall be limited to plus or minus fifty percent. Premiummodifications resulting from a risk modeling system shall be reportedseparately under the uniform statistical plan from premiummodifications resulting from a schedule rating plan.(d) Premium credits or reductions shall not be removed or reducedunless there is a change in the insurer, the insurer amends orwithdraws the rating plan, or unless there is a corresponding changein the insured employer's operations or risk characteristicsunderlying the credit or reduction.

Experience rating plan, contents.
287.957. The experience rating plan shall contain reasonable eligibility standards, provide adequate incentives for loss prevention, and shall provide for sufficient premium differentials so as to encourage safety. The uniform experience rating plan shall be the exclusive means of providing prospective premium adjustment based upon measurement of the loss-producing characteristics of an individual insured. An insurer may submit a rating plan or plans providing for retrospective premium adjustments based upon an insured's past experience. Such system shall provide for retrospective adjustment of an experience modification and premiums paid pursuant to such experience modification where a prior reserved claim produced an experience modification that varied by greater than fifty percent from the experience modification that would have been established based on the settlement amount of that claim. The rating plan shall prohibit an adjustment to the experience modification of an employer if the total medical cost does not exceed twenty percent of the current split point of primary and excess losses under the uniform experience rating plan, and the employer pays all of the total medical costs and there is no lost time from the employment, other than the first three days or less of disability under subsection 1 of section 287.160, and no claim is filed. An employer opting to utilize this provision maintains an obligation to report the injury under subsection 1 of section 287.380.

Disapproval of rate, when, how--procedures, director's powers--effect.
  287.960. 1. A rate may be disapproved at any time
subsequent to the effective date. A rate subject to prefiling
under section 287.947 may also be disapproved before the
effective date. A rate for a residual market in which insurers
are mandated by law to participate shall not become effective
until approved by the director, as provided in section 287.896.
  2. The director may disapprove a rate for use in a
competitive market if the director finds that the rate is
inadequate or unfairly discriminatory under section 287.950. The
director shall disapprove a rate for use in a noncompetitive
market if he finds that the rate is excessive, inadequate or
unfairly discriminatory under section 287.950.
  3. If the director finds that a reasonable degree of
competition does not exist in a market in accordance with section
287.942, the director may require that the insurers in that
market file supporting information in support of existing rates.
If the director believes that such rates may violate any of the
requirements of sections 287.930 to 287.975, a hearing shall be
called prior to any disapproval.
  4. If the director believes that rates in a competitive
market violate the inadequacy or unfair discrimination standard
in section 287.950 or any other applicable requirement of this
act*, the director may require that the insurers in that market
file supporting information in support of existing rates. If
after reviewing the supporting rate information, the director
continues to believe that the rates may violate these
requirements, a hearing shall be called prior to any disapproval.
  5. The director may disapprove, without hearing, rates
prefiled pursuant to section 287.947 that have not become
effective; however, the insurer whose rates have been disapproved
shall be given a hearing upon a written request made within
thirty days after the disapproval order.
  6. If the director disapproves a rate, the director shall
issue an order specifying in what respects it fails to meet the
requirements of sections 287.930 to 287.975 and stating when,
within a reasonable period thereafter, such rate shall be
discontinued for any policy issued or renewed after a date
specified in the order. The order shall be issued subject to the
requirements of section 287.962. Such order may include a
provision for premium adjustment for the period after the
effective date of the order for policies in effect on such date.
  7. Whenever an insurer has no legally effective rates as a
result of the director's disapproval of rates or other act, the
director shall on request of the insurer specify interim rates
for the insurer that are high enough to protect the interests of
all parties and may order that a specified portion of the
premiums be placed in an escrow account approved by him. When
new rates become legally effective, the director shall order the
escrowed funds or any overcharge in the interim rates to be
distributed appropriately, except that refunds of less than ten
dollars per policyholder shall not be required.    Effective 1-1-94

conducted pursuant to this section shall be specifically stated
in the record.
  3. Any insurer or the advisory organization may obtain a
judicial declaration as to the validity of any order by bringing
an action for declaratory relief. The right to judicial
determination shall not be affected by the failure to seek
reconsideration of the order. The order may be declared invalid
for failure to comply with the provisions of sections 287.930 to

individuals through whom it acts are competent, trustworthy and
technically qualified to provide the services proposed, and that
all requirements of law are met, shall issue one license to
designate the advisory organization which specifies the

developed by the director, for each of the various job classifications. Such
data may be used, at their option, by workers' compensation insurers,
self-funded employers, or self-insured groups of employers, to determine their
own final rates or charges for workers' compensation insurance coverage. The
authority to establish such a reporting format shall not be interpreted as
allowing the director of the department of insurance, financial institutions
and professional registration to set final rates where a competitive market
exists under the provisions of sections 287.930 to 287.975.    (L. 1993 S.B. 251 Â§ 34, A.L. 2005 S.B. 1 & 130)

===================================================================



 

4121.02 Industrial commission.
(A) There is hereby created the industrial commission. The commission shall consist of three members appointed by the governor, with the advice and consent of the senate. One member shall be an individual who, on account of the individual's previous vocation, employment, or affiliations, can be classed as a representative of employers; one shall be an individual who, on account of the individual's previous vocation, employment, or affiliations, can be classed as a representative of employees; and one shall be an individual who, on account of the individual's previous vocation, employment, or affiliations, can be classed as a representative of the public. Each member shall have six or more years of recognized expertise in the field of workers' compensation, and at least one member shall be an attorney registered to practice law in this state. No more than two members of the industrial commission shall belong to or be affiliated with the same political party.
(B) Within thirty days after the industrial commission nominating council submits its list to the governor under division (D) of this section, the governor shall make initial appointments to the commission. Of the initial appointments, the member who is a representative of employees shall serve a term ending on June 30, 1995; the member who is a representative of employers shall serve a term ending on June 30, 1997; and the member who is a representative of the public shall serve a term ending on June 30, 1999. Thereafter, terms of office are for six years, beginning on the first day of July and ending on the thirtieth day of June.
(C) Each member shall hold office from the date of the member's confirmation by the senate, as provided in division (E) of this section, until the end of the term for which the member was appointed, except that if a member has not been appointed by the end of the term, the member shall remain in office until the member's successor takes office, or until a period of sixty days has elapsed, whichever occurs first. However, if a member is appointed to fill a full term subsequent to an initial appointment, the term of office is as provided in division (B) of this section. The governor shall not appoint any person to more than two full six-year terms of office on the commission. This restriction does not prevent the governor from appointing a person to fill a vacancy caused by death, resignation, or removal of a commission member, or from appointing that person twice to full terms on the commission, or from appointing a person previously appointed to fill less than a full term twice to full terms on the commission. Except for the public member's tenure as chairperson of the self-insuring employer's evaluation board, a member of the commission shall hold no other office of trust or profit, engage in any other occupation or business, or serve on any committee of any political party and shall devote full time to the member's duties as a member of the commission.
(D) In making appointments to the commission, the governor shall select the members from the list of the names submitted by the industrial commission nominating council pursuant to this division. Within thirty days after October 20, 1993, the nominating council shall submit to the governor for the initial appointments a list containing three separate names for the employer, employee, and public members to be filled. Within seven days of the submission of the initial list, the governor shall either appoint individuals from the list or request the nominating council to submit another list of three names for each member the governor has not appointed from the original list, which list the nominating council shall submit to the governor within seven days of the governor's request. The governor then shall appoint, within seven days of the submission of the second list, individuals from either list to fill each position for which the governor has not made an appointment from the original list. Thereafter, within sixty days of a vacancy occurring as a result of the expiration of a term and within thirty days after other vacancies occurring on the commission, the nominating council shall submit an initial list containing three names for each vacancy. Within seven days of the submission of the initial list, the governor shall either appoint individuals from the list or request the nominating council to submit another list of three names for each member the governor has not appointed from the original list, which list the nominating council shall submit to the governor within fourteen days of the governor's request. The governor then shall appoint, within seven days of the submission of the second list, one of the individuals from either list to fill the vacancy for which the governor has not made an appointment from the original list. In order for a name of an individual to be submitted to the governor under this division, the nominating council shall approve the individual by an affirmative vote of not less than two-thirds of its members.
(E) The governor shall notify the senate of the names of the individuals for whom the governor is making the initial appointments to the commission within thirty days after the submission of the names to the governor by the industrial commission nominating council under division (D) of this section. For appointments subsequent to the initial appointments under this division, if the appointment is to fill a member's term which is to expire, the governor shall notify the senate of the name of the individual to be appointed to fill that position by no later than the first day of June of the year that the term is to expire. For subsequent appointments to fill a vacancy on the commission occurring as a result of the death, resignation, or removal of the commission member, the governor shall notify the senate of the name of the individual to be appointed to fill the remainder of that term within thirty days after the submission of the names to the governor by the nominating council under division (D) of this section. For all appointments, the senate shall refer the matter to an appropriate standing committee for consideration of the appointments, and the committee shall hold a public hearing to consider the appointments. After conclusion of the public hearing, the standing committee shall make its recommendations to the senate. The senate shall not confirm any appointee if the individual does not meet the qualifications of division (A) of this section or if the individual has not been approved by the industrial commission nominating council as provided in division (D) of this section. If the full senate fails to take a final vote on an appointment within thirty days after the governor submits the names to the senate under this division, the individual's appointment is deemed confirmed by the senate and the individual shall take the office of commission member subject to removal as provided in division (F) of this section.
(F) The governor may remove or suspend a member of the commission pursuant to section 3.04 of the Revised Code. The governor shall notify the senate of any decision to remove or suspend a commission member. The senate shall refer the matter to an appropriate standing committee for consideration and the committee shall hold a public hearing to consider the matter. At the hearing, the governor or the governor's authorized representative may present evidence and give testimony in support of the decision. The commission member or the member's authorized representatives may appear and present evidence and testimony. After conclusion of the public hearing, the committee shall make its recommendation to the senate.
Upon receipt of a recommendation from the standing committee, the senate shall vote on the issue of whether to advise and consent to the removal or suspension of the member. The senate shall vote on the matter within sixty legislative days from the date the governor communicates the decision to remove or suspend the member.
(G) The governor shall determine the compensation of the members of the commission, based upon such facts as the governor considers appropriate, provided that the salary of each member shall be no less than seventy-five thousand dollars per year. In addition, each commission member shall receive an annual salary increase based upon the average salary increases of other state department directors for that year, not to exceed five per cent per year.
(H) Before entering upon the duties of office, each member shall take and subscribe to the constitutional oath of office and swear and affirm that the member holds no position under any committee of a political party, which oath or affirmation the member shall file in the office of the governor. Each member shall give a bond in the sum of fifty thousand dollars, which bond shall be approved by the governor and filed with the treasurer of state. All employees or deputies of the commission who receive or disburse state funds shall give a bond to the state in the amounts and surety approved by the industrial commission.
(I) As used in this section only, "office of trust or profit" means:
(1) A federal or state elective office or an elected office of a political subdivision of the state;
(2) A position on a board or commission of the state that is appointed by the governor;
(3) An office set forth in section 121.03, 121.04, or 121.05 of the Revised Code;

===================================================================



 

4121.121 Bureau of workers' compensation - appointment, powers and duties of administrator - chief operating officer.
(A) There is hereby created the bureau of workers' compensation, which shall be administered by the administrator of workers' compensation. A person appointed to the position of administrator shall possess significant management experience in effectively managing an organization or organizations of substantial size and complexity. A person appointed to the position of administrator also shall possess a minimum of five years of experience in the field of workers' compensation insurance or in another insurance industry, except as otherwise provided when the conditions specified in division (C) of this section are satisfied. The governor shall appoint the administrator as provided in section 121.03 of the Revised Code, and the administrator shall serve at the pleasure of the governor. The governor shall fix the administrator's salary on the basis of the administrator's experience and the administrator's responsibilities and duties under this chapter and Chapters 4123., 4125., 4127., 4131., and 4167. of the Revised Code. The governor shall not appoint to the position of administrator any person who has, or whose spouse has, given a contribution to the campaign committee of the governor in an amount greater than one thousand dollars during the two-year period immediately preceding the date of the appointment of the administrator.
The administrator shall hold no other public office and shall devote full time to the duties of administrator. Before entering upon the duties of the office, the administrator shall take an oath of office as required by sections 3.22 and 3.23 of the Revised Code, and shall file in the office of the secretary of state, a bond signed by the administrator and by surety approved by the governor, for the sum of fifty thousand dollars payable to the state, conditioned upon the faithful performance of the administrator's duties.
(B) The administrator is responsible for the management of the bureau and for the discharge of all administrative duties imposed upon the administrator in this chapter and Chapters 4123., 4125., 4127., 4131., and 4167. of the Revised Code, and in the discharge thereof shall do all of the following:
(1) Perform all acts and exercise all authorities and powers, discretionary and otherwise that are required of or vested in the bureau or any of its employees in this chapter and Chapters 4123., 4125., 4127., 4131., and 4167. of the Revised Code, except the acts and the exercise of authority and power that is required of and vested in the bureau of workers' compensation board of directors or the industrial commission pursuant to those chapters. The treasurer of state shall honor all warrants signed by the administrator, or by one or more of the administrator's employees, authorized by the administrator in writing, or bearing the facsimile signature of the administrator or such employee under sections 4123.42 and 4123.44 of the Revised Code.
(2) Employ, direct, and supervise all employees required in connection with the performance of the duties assigned to the bureau by this chapter and Chapters 4123., 4125., 4127., 4131., and 4167. of the Revised Code, including an actuary, and may establish job classification plans and compensation for all employees of the bureau provided that this grant of authority shall not be construed as affecting any employee for whom the state employment relations board has established an appropriate bargaining unit under section 4117.06 of the Revised Code. All positions of employment in the bureau are in the classified civil service except those employees the administrator may appoint to serve at the administrator's pleasure in the unclassified civil service pursuant to section 124.11 of the Revised Code. The administrator shall fix the salaries of employees the administrator appoints to serve at the administrator's pleasure, including the chief operating officer, staff physicians, and other senior management personnel of the bureau and shall establish the compensation of staff attorneys of the bureau's legal section and their immediate supervisors, and take whatever steps are necessary to provide adequate compensation for other staff attorneys.
The administrator may appoint a person who holds a certified position in the classified service within the bureau to a position in the unclassified service within the bureau. A person appointed pursuant to this division to a position in the unclassified service shall retain the right to resume the position and status held by the person in the classified service immediately prior to the person's appointment in the unclassified service, regardless of the number of positions the person held in the unclassified service. An employee's right to resume a position in the classified service may only be exercised when the administrator demotes the employee to a pay range lower than the employee's current pay range or revokes the employee's appointment to the unclassified service. An employee who holds a position in the classified service and who is appointed to a position in the unclassified service on or after January 1, 2016, shall have the right to resume a position in the classified service under this division only within five years after the effective date of the employee's appointment in the unclassified service. An employee forfeits the right to resume a position in the classified service when the employee is removed from the position in the unclassified service due to incompetence, inefficiency, dishonesty, drunkenness, immoral conduct, insubordination, discourteous treatment of the public, neglect of duty, violation of this chapter or Chapter 124., 4123., 4125., 4127., 4131., or 4167. of the Revised Code, violation of the rules of the director of administrative services or the administrator, any other failure of good behavior, any other acts of misfeasance, malfeasance, or nonfeasance in office, or conviction of a felony while employed in the civil service. An employee also forfeits the right to resume a position in the classified service upon transfer to a different agency.
Reinstatement to a position in the classified service shall be to a position substantially equal to that position in the classified service held previously, as certified by the department of administrative services. If the position the person previously held in the classified service has been placed in the unclassified service or is otherwise unavailable, the person shall be appointed to a position in the classified service within the bureau that the director of administrative services certifies is comparable in compensation to the position the person previously held in the classified service. Service in the position in the unclassified service shall be counted as service in the position in the classified service held by the person immediately prior to the person's appointment in the unclassified service. When a person is reinstated to a position in the classified service as provided in this division, the person is entitled to all rights, status, and benefits accruing to the position during the person's time of service in the position in the unclassified service.
(3) Reorganize the work of the bureau, its sections, departments, and offices to the extent necessary to achieve the most efficient performance of its functions and to that end may establish, change, or abolish positions and assign and reassign duties and responsibilities of every employee of the bureau. All persons employed by the commission in positions that, after November 3, 1989, are supervised and directed by the administrator under this section are transferred to the bureau in their respective classifications but subject to reassignment and reclassification of position and compensation as the administrator determines to be in the interest of efficient administration. The civil service status of any person employed by the commission is not affected by this section. Personnel employed by the bureau or the commission who are subject to Chapter 4117. of the Revised Code shall retain all of their rights and benefits conferred pursuant to that chapter as it presently exists or is hereafter amended and nothing in this chapter or Chapter 4123. of the Revised Code shall be construed as eliminating or interfering with Chapter 4117. of the Revised Code or the rights and benefits conferred under that chapter to public employees or to any bargaining unit.
(4) Provide offices, equipment, supplies, and other facilities for the bureau.
(5) Prepare and submit to the board information the administrator considers pertinent or the board requires, together with the administrator's recommendations, in the form of administrative rules, for the advice and consent of the board, for classifications of occupations or industries, for premium rates and contributions, for the amount to be credited to the surplus fund, for rules and systems of rating, rate revisions, and merit rating. The administrator shall obtain, prepare, and submit any other information the board requires for the prompt and efficient discharge of its duties.
(6) Keep the accounts required by division (A) of section 4123.34 of the Revised Code and all other accounts and records necessary to the collection, administration, and distribution of the workers' compensation funds and shall obtain the statistical and other information required by section 4123.19 of the Revised Code.
(7) Exercise the investment powers vested in the administrator by section 4123.44 of the Revised Code in accordance with the investment policy approved by the board pursuant to section 4121.12 of the Revised Code and in consultation with the chief investment officer of the bureau of workers' compensation. The administrator shall not engage in any prohibited investment activity specified by the board pursuant to division (F)(9) of section 4121.12 of the Revised Code and shall not invest in any type of investment specified in divisions (B)(1) to (10) of section 4123.442 of the Revised Code. All business shall be transacted, all funds invested, all warrants for money drawn and payments made, and all cash and securities and other property held, in the name of the bureau, or in the name of its nominee, provided that nominees are authorized by the administrator solely for the purpose of facilitating the transfer of securities, and restricted to the administrator and designated employees.
(8) In accordance with Chapter 125. of the Revised Code, purchase supplies, materials, equipment, and services.
(9) Prepare and submit to the board an annual budget for internal operating purposes for the board's approval. The administrator also shall, separately from the budget the industrial commission submits, prepare and submit to the director of budget and management a budget for each biennium. The budgets submitted to the board and the director shall include estimates of the costs and necessary expenditures of the bureau in the discharge of any duty imposed by law.
(10) As promptly as possible in the course of efficient administration, decentralize and relocate such of the personnel and activities of the bureau as is appropriate to the end that the receipt, investigation, determination, and payment of claims may be undertaken at or near the place of injury or the residence of the claimant and for that purpose establish regional offices, in such places as the administrator considers proper, capable of discharging as many of the functions of the bureau as is practicable so as to promote prompt and efficient administration in the processing of claims. All active and inactive lost-time claims files shall be held at the service office responsible for the claim. A claimant, at the claimant's request, shall be provided with information by telephone as to the location of the file pertaining to the claimant's claim. The administrator shall ensure that all service office employees report directly to the director for their service office.
(11) Provide a written binder on new coverage where the administrator considers it to be in the best interest of the risk. The administrator, or any other person authorized by the administrator, shall grant the binder upon submission of a request for coverage by the employer. A binder is effective for a period of thirty days from date of issuance and is nonrenewable. Payroll reports and premium charges shall coincide with the effective date of the binder.
(12) Set standards for the reasonable and maximum handling time of claims payment functions, ensure, by rules, the impartial and prompt treatment of all claims and employer risk accounts, and establish a secure, accurate method of time stamping all incoming mail and documents hand delivered to bureau employees.
(13) Ensure that all employees of the bureau follow the orders and rules of the commission as such orders and rules relate to the commission's overall adjudicatory policy-making and management duties under this chapter and Chapters 4123., 4127., and 4131. of the Revised Code.
(14) Manage and operate a data processing system with a common data base for the use of both the bureau and the commission and, in consultation with the commission, using electronic data processing equipment, shall develop a claims tracking system that is sufficient to monitor the status of a claim at any time and that lists appeals that have been filed and orders or determinations that have been issued pursuant to section 4123.511 or 4123.512 of the Revised Code, including the dates of such filings and issuances.
(15) Establish and maintain a medical section within the bureau. The medical section shall do all of the following:

(16) Appoint, as the administrator determines necessary, panels to review and advise the administrator on disputes arising over a determination that a health care service or supply provided to a claimant is not covered under this chapter or Chapter 4123., 4127., or 4131. of the Revised Code or is medically unnecessary. If an individual health care provider is involved in the dispute, the panel shall consist of individuals licensed pursuant to the same section of the Revised Code as such health care provider.
(17) Pursuant to section 4123.65 of the Revised Code, approve applications for the final settlement of claims for compensation or benefits under this chapter and Chapters 4123., 4127., and 4131. of the Revised Code as the administrator determines appropriate, except in regard to the applications of self-insuring employers and their employees.

Any employer may elect to include as an "employee" within this chapter, any person excluded from the definition of "employee" pursuant to division (A)(2)(a), (b), (c), or (e) of this section in accordance with rules adopted by the administrator, with the advice and consent of the bureau of workers' compensation board of directors. If an employer is a partnership, sole proprietorship, individual incorporated as a corporation, or family farm corporation, such employer may elect to include as an "employee" within this chapter, any member of such partnership, the owner of the sole proprietorship, the individual incorporated as a corporation, or the officers of the family farm corporation.

For informational purposes only, the bureau shall prescribe such language as it considers appropriate, on such of its forms as it considers appropriate, to advise employers of their right to elect to include as an "employee" within this chapter a sole proprietor, any member of a partnership, or a person excluded from the definition of "employee" under division (A)(2)(a), (b), (c), or (e) of this section, that they should check any health and disability insurance policy, or other form of health and disability plan or contract, presently covering them, or the purchase of which they may be considering, to determine whether such policy, plan, or contract excludes benefits for illness or injury that they might have elected to have covered by workers' compensation.

(4) A condition that pre-existed an injury unless that pre-existing condition is substantially aggravated by the injury. Such a substantial aggravation must be documented by objective diagnostic findings, objective clinical findings, or objective test results. Subjective complaints may be evidence of such a substantial aggravation. However, subjective complaints without objective diagnostic findings, objective clinical findings, or objective test results are insufficient to substantiate a substantial aggravation.
(D) "Child" includes a posthumous child and a child legally adopted prior to the injury.

===================================================================



 

4123.15 Recognized religious sect employer may apply for exemption.
(A) An employer who is a member of a recognized religious sect or division of a recognized religious sect and who is an adherent of established tenets or teachings of that sect or division by reason of which the employer is conscientiously opposed to benefits to employers and employees from any public or private insurance that makes payment in the event of death, disability, impairment, old age, or retirement or makes payments toward the cost of, or provides services in connection with the payment for, medical services, including the benefits from any insurance system established by the "Social Security Act," 42 U.S.C.A. 30l, et seq., may apply to the administrator of workers' compensation to be excepted from payment of premiums and other charges assessed under this chapter and Chapter 4121. of the Revised Code with respect to, or if the employer is a self-insuring employer, from payment of direct compensation and benefits to and assessments required by this chapter and Chapter 4121. of the Revised Code on account of, an individual employee who meets the requirements of this section. The employer shall make an application on forms provided by the bureau of workers' compensation which forms may be those used by or similar to those used by the United States internal revenue service for the purpose of granting an exemption from payment of social security taxes under 26 U.S.C.A. 1402(g) of the Internal Revenue Code, and shall include a written waiver signed by the individual employee to be excepted from all the benefits and compensation provided in this chapter and Chapter 4121. of the Revised Code.
The application also shall include affidavits signed by the employer and the individual employee that the employer and the individual employee are members of a recognized religious sect or division of a recognized religious sect and are adherents of established tenets or teaching of that sect or division by reason of which the employer and the individual employee are conscientiously opposed to benefits to employers and employees received from any public or private insurance that makes payments in the event of death, disability, impairment, old age, or retirement or makes payments toward the cost of, or provides services in connection with the payment for, medical services, including the benefits from any insurance system established by the "Social Security Act," 42 U.S.C.A. 301, et seq. If the individual is a minor, the guardian of the minor shall complete the waiver and affidavit required by this division.
(B) The administrator shall grant the waiver and exception to the employer for a particular individual employee if the administrator finds that the employer and the individual employee are members of a sect or division having the established tenets or teachings described in division (A) of this section, that it is the practice, and has been for a substantial number of years, for members of the sect or division of the sect to make provision for their dependent members which, in the administrator's judgment, is reasonable in view of their general level of hiring, and that the sect or division of the sect has been in existence at all times since December 31, 1950.
(C) A waiver and exception under division (B) of this section is effective on the date the administrator grants the waiver and exception. An employer who complies with this chapter and the employer's other employees, with respect to an individual employee for whom the administrator grants the waiver and exception, are entitled, as to that individual employee and as to all injuries and occupational diseases of the individual employee that occurred prior to the effective date of the waiver and exception, to the protections of sections 4123.74 and 4123.741 of the Revised Code. On and after the effective date of the waiver and exception, the employer is not liable for the payment of any premiums or other charges assessed under this chapter or Chapter 4121. of the Revised Code, or if the individual is a self-insuring employer, the employer is not liable for the payment of any compensation or benefits directly or other charges assessed under this chapter or Chapter 4121. of the Revised Code in regard to that individual employee, and is considered a complying employer under those chapters, and the employer and the employer's other employees are entitled to the protections of sections 4123.74 and 4123.741 of the Revised Code, as to that individual employee, and as to injuries and occupational diseases of that individual employee that occur on and after the effective date of the waiver and exception.
(D) A waiver and exception granted in regard to a specific employer and individual employee are valid for all future years unless the administrator determines that the employer, individual employee, or sect or division ceases to meet the requirements of this section. If the administrator makes this determination, the employer is liable for the payment of premiums and other charges assessed under this chapter and Chapter 4121. of the Revised Code, or if the employer is a self-insuring employer, the employer is liable for the payment of compensation and benefits directly and other charges assessed under those chapters, in regard to the individual employee for all injuries and occupational diseases of that individual that occur on and after the date of the administrator's determination, and the individual employee is entitled to all of the benefits and compensation provided in those chapters for an injury or occupational disease that occurs on or after the date of the administrator's determination.

--->ohio--->Ohio Statutes--->Chapter 4123: Workers' Compensation--->4123.29 Duties of administrator.
===================================================================



 

4123.29 Duties of administrator.
(A) The administrator of workers' compensation, subject to the approval of the bureau of workers' compensation board of directors, shall do all of the following:
(1) Classify occupations or industries with respect to their degree of hazard and determine the risks of the different classes according to the categories the national council on compensation insurance establishes that are applicable to employers in this state;
(2)
(a) Fix the rates of premium of the risks of the classes based upon the total payroll in each of the classes of occupation or industry sufficiently large to provide a fund for the compensation provided for in this chapter and to maintain a state insurance fund from year to year. The administrator shall set the rates at a level that assures the solvency of the fund. Where the payroll cannot be obtained or, in the opinion of the administrator, is not an adequate measure for determining the premium to be paid for the degree of hazard, the administrator may determine the rates of premium upon such other basis, consistent with insurance principles, as is equitable in view of the degree of hazard, and whenever in this chapter reference is made to payroll or expenditure of wages with reference to fixing premiums, the reference shall be construed to have been made also to such other basis for fixing the rates of premium as the administrator may determine under this section.
(b) If an employer elects to obtain other-states' coverage, including limited other-states' coverage, pursuant to section 4123.292 of the Revised Code through the administrator, if the administrator elects to offer such coverage, calculate the employer's premium for the state insurance fund in the same manner as otherwise required under division (A) of this section and section 4123.34 of the Revised Code, except that the administrator may establish in rule an alternative calculation of the employer's premium to appropriately account for the expenditure of wages, payroll, or both attributable to the labor performed and services provided by that employer's employees when those employees performed labor and provided services in this state and in the other state or states for which the employer elects to secure other-states' coverage .
(c) If an employer elects to obtain other-states' coverage pursuant to section 4123.292 of the Revised Code through an other-states' insurer, calculate the employer's premium for the state insurance fund in the same manner as otherwise required under division (A) of this section and section 4123.34 of the Revised Code, except that when the administrator determines the expenditure of wages, payroll, or both upon which to base the employer's premium, the administrator shall use only the expenditure of wages, payroll, or both attributable to the labor performed and services provided by that employer's employees when those employees performed labor and provided services in this state only and to which the other-states' coverage does not apply. The administrator may adopt rules setting forth the information that an employer electing to obtain other-states' coverage through an other-states' insurer shall report for purposes of determining the expenditure of wages, payroll, or both attributable to the labor performed and services provided in this state.
(d) The administrator in setting or revising rates shall furnish to employers an adequate explanation of the basis for the rates set.
(3) Develop and make available to employers who are paying premiums to the state insurance fund alternative premium plans. Alternative premium plans shall include retrospective rating plans. The administrator may make available plans under which an advanced deposit may be applied against a specified deductible amount per claim.
(4)
(a) Offer to insure the obligations of employers under this chapter under a plan that groups, for rating purposes, employers, and pools the risk of the employers within the group provided that the employers meet all of the following conditions:
(i) All of the employers within the group are members of an organization that has been in existence for at least two years prior to the date of application for group coverage;
(ii) The organization was formed for purposes other than that of obtaining group workers' compensation under this division;
(iii) The employers' business in the organization is substantially similar such that the risks which are grouped are substantially homogeneous;
(iv) The group of employers consists of at least one hundred members or the aggregate workers' compensation premiums of the members, as determined by the administrator, are estimated to exceed one hundred fifty thousand dollars during the coverage period;
(v) The formation and operation of the group program in the organization will substantially improve accident prevention and claims handling for the employers in the group;
(vi) Each employer seeking to enroll in a group for workers' compensation coverage has an account in good standing with the bureau of workers' compensation . The administrator shall adopt rules setting forth the criteria by which the administrator will determine whether an employer's account is in good standing.
(b) If an organization sponsors more than one employer group to participate in group plans established under this section, that organization may submit a single application that supplies all of the information necessary for each group of employers that the organization wishes to sponsor.
(c) In providing employer group plans under division (A)(4) of this section, the administrator shall consider an employer group as a single employing entity for purposes of group rating. No employer may be a member of more than one group for the purpose of obtaining workers' compensation coverage under this division.
(d) At the time the administrator revises premium rates pursuant to this section and section 4123.34 of the Revised Code, if the premium rate of an employer who participates in a group plan established under this section changes from the rate established for the previous year, the administrator, in addition to sending the invoice with the rate revision to that employer, shall send a copy of that invoice to the third-party administrator that administers the group plan for that employer's group.
(e) In providing employer group plans under division (A)(4) of this section, the administrator shall establish a program designed to mitigate the impact of a significant claim that would come into the experience of a private, state fund group-rated employer or a taxing district employer for the first time and be a contributing factor in that employer being excluded from a group-rated plan. The administrator shall establish eligibility criteria and requirements that such employers must satisfy in order to participate in this program. For purposes of this program, the administrator shall establish a discount on premium rates applicable to employers who qualify for the program.
(f) In no event shall division (A)(4) of this section be construed as granting to an employer status as a self-insuring employer.
(g) The administrator shall develop classifications of occupations or industries that are sufficiently distinct so as not to group employers in classifications that unfairly represent the risks of employment with the employer.
(5) Generally promote employer participation in the state insurance fund through the regular dissemination of information to all classes of employers describing the advantages and benefits of opting to make premium payments to the fund. To that end, the administrator shall regularly make employers aware of the various workers' compensation premium packages developed and offered pursuant to this section.
(6) Make available to every employer who is paying premiums to the state insurance fund a program whereby the employer or the employer's agent pays to the claimant or on behalf of the claimant the first fifteen thousand dollars of a compensable workers' compensation medical-only claim filed by that claimant that is related to the same injury or occupational disease. No formal application is required; however, an employer must elect to participate by telephoning the bureau after July 1, 1995. Once an employer has elected to participate in the program, the employer will be responsible for all bills in all medical-only claims with a date of injury the same or later than the election date, unless the employer notifies the bureau within fourteen days of receipt of the notification of a claim being filed that it does not wish to pay the bills in that claim, or the employer notifies the bureau that the fifteen thousand dollar maximum has been paid, or the employer notifies the bureau of the last day of service on which it will be responsible for the bills in a particular medical-only claim. If an employer elects to enter the program, the administrator shall not reimburse the employer for such amounts paid and shall not charge the first fifteen thousand dollars of any medical-only claim paid by an employer to the employer's experience or otherwise use it in merit rating or determining the risks of any employer for the purpose of payment of premiums under this chapter. A certified health care provider shall extend to an employer who participates in this program the same rates for services rendered to an employee of that employer as the provider bills the administrator for the same type of medical claim processed by the bureau and shall not charge, assess, or otherwise attempt to collect from an employee any amount for covered services or supplies that is in excess of that rate. If an employer elects to enter the program and the employer fails to pay a bill for a medical-only claim included in the program, the employer shall be liable for that bill and the employee for whom the employer failed to pay the bill shall not be liable for that bill. The administrator shall adopt rules to implement and administer division (A)(6) of this section. Upon written request from the bureau, the employer shall provide documentation to the bureau of all medical-only bills that they are paying directly. Such requests from the bureau may not be made more frequently than on a semiannual basis. Failure to provide such documentation to the bureau within thirty days of receipt of the request may result in the employer's forfeiture of participation in the program for such injury. The provisions of this section shall not apply to claims in which an employer with knowledge of a claimed compensable injury or occupational disease, has paid wages in lieu of compensation or total disability.
(B) The administrator, with the advice and consent of the board, by rule, may do both of the following:
(1) Grant an employer who pays the employer's annual estimated premium in full prior to the start of the policy year for which the estimated premium is due, a discount as the administrator fixes from time to time;
(2) Levy a minimum annual administrative charge upon risks where premium reports develop a charge less than the administrator considers adequate to offset administrative costs of processing.

The administrator of workers' compensation, with the advice and consent of the bureau of workers' compensation board of directors, shall adopt rules with respect to the collection, maintenance, and disbursements of the state insurance fund including all of the following:
(A)
A rule providing for ascertaining the correctness of any employer's report of estimated or actual expenditure of wages and the determination and adjustment of proper premiums and the payment of those premiums by the employer ;
(B) Such special rules as the administrator considers necessary to safeguard the fund and that are just in the circumstances, covering the rates to be applied where one employer takes over the occupation or industry of another or where an employer first makes application for state insurance, and the administrator may require that if any employer transfers a business in whole or in part or otherwise reorganizes the business, the successor in interest shall assume, in proportion to the extent of the transfer, as determined by the administrator, the employer's account and shall continue the payment of all contributions due under this chapter;
(C) A rule providing that an employer who employs an employee covered under the federal "Longshore and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act," 98 Stat. 1639, 33 U.S.C. 901 et seq., and this chapter and Chapter 4121. of the Revised Code shall be assessed a premium in accordance with the expenditure of wages, payroll, or both attributable to only labor performed and services provided by such an employee when the employee performs labor and provides services for which the employee is not eligible to receive compensation and benefits under that federal act.
(D) A rule providing for all of the following:
(1) If an employer fails to file a report of the employer's actual payroll expenditures pursuant to section 4123.26 of the Revised Code for private employers or pursuant to section 4123.41 of the Revised Code for public employers, the premium and assessments due from the employer for the period shall be calculated based on the estimated payroll of the employer used in calculating the estimated premium due, increased by ten per cent;
(2) (a) If an employer fails to pay the premium or assessments when due for a policy year commencing prior to July 1, 2015, the administrator may add a late fee penalty of not more than thirty dollars to the premium plus an additional penalty amount as follows:
(i) For a premium from sixty-one to ninety days past due, the prime interest rate, multiplied by the premium due;
(ii) For a premium from ninety-one to one hundred twenty days past due, the prime interest rate plus two per cent, multiplied by the premium due;
(iii) For a premium from one hundred twenty-one to one hundred fifty days past due, the prime interest rate plus four per cent, multiplied by the premium due;
(iv) For a premium from one hundred fifty-one to one hundred eighty days past due, the prime interest rate plus six per cent, multiplied by the premium due;
(v) For a premium from one hundred eighty-one to two hundred ten days past due, the prime interest rate plus eight per cent, multiplied by the premium due;
(vi) For each additional thirty-day period or portion thereof that a premium remains past due after it has remained past due for more than two hundred ten days, the prime interest rate plus eight per cent, multiplied by the premium due.
(b) For purposes of division (D)(2)(a) of this section, "prime interest rate" means the average bank prime rate, and the administrator shall determine the prime interest rate in the same manner as a county auditor determines the average bank prime rate under section 929.02 of the Revised Code.
(c) If an employer fails to pay the premium or assessments when due for a policy year commencing on or after July 1, 2015, the administrator may assess a penalty at the interest rate established by the state tax commissioner pursuant to section 5703.47 of the Revised Code.
(3) Notwithstanding the interest rates specified in division (D)(2)(a) or (c) of this section, at no time shall the additional penalty amount assessed under division (D)(2)(a) or (c) of this section exceed fifteen per cent of the premium due.
(4) If an employer recognized by the administrator as a professional employer organization fails to make a timely payment of premiums or assessments as required by section 4123.35 of the Revised Code, the administrator shall revoke the professional employer organization's registration pursuant to section 4125.06 of the Revised Code.
(5) An employer may appeal a late fee penalty or additional penalty to an adjudicating committee pursuant to section 4123.291 of the Revised Code.
(6) If the employer files an appropriate payroll report within the time provided by law , the employer shall not be in default and division (D)(2) of this section shall not apply if the employer pays the premiums within fifteen days after being first notified by the administrator of the amount due.
(7) Any deficiencies in the amounts of the premium security deposit paid by an employer prior to July 1, 2015, shall be subject to an interest charge of six per cent per annum from the date the premium obligation is incurred. In determining the interest due on deficiencies in premium security deposit payments, a charge in each case shall be made against the employer in an amount equal to interest at the rate of six per cent per annum on the premium security deposit due but remaining unpaid sixty days after notice by the administrator.
(8) Any interest charges or penalties provided for in divisions (D)(2) and (7) of this section shall be credited to the employer's account for rating purposes in the same manner as premiums.
(E) A rule providing that each employer, on the occasion of instituting coverage under this chapter for an effective date prior to July 1, 2015, shall submit a premium security deposit. The deposit shall be calculated equivalent to thirty per cent of the semiannual premium obligation of the employer based upon the employer's estimated expenditure for wages for the ensuing six-month period plus thirty per cent of an additional adjustment period of two months but only up to a maximum of one thousand dollars and not less than ten dollars. The administrator shall review the security deposit of every employer who has submitted a deposit which is less than the one-thousand-dollar maximum. The administrator may require any such employer to submit additional money up to the maximum of one thousand dollars that, in the administrator's opinion, reflects the employer's current payroll expenditure for an eight-month period.
(F) A rule providing that each employer, on the occasion of instituting coverage under this chapter, shall submit an application fee and an application for coverage that completely provides all of the information required for the administrator to establish coverage for that employer, and that the employer's failure to pay the application fee or to provide all of the information requested on the application may be grounds for the administrator to deny coverage for that employer.
(G) A rule providing that, in addition to any other remedies permitted in this chapter, the administrator may discontinue an employer's coverage if the employer fails to pay the premium due on or before the premium's due date.
(H) A rule providing that if after a final adjudication it is determined that an employer has failed to pay an obligation, billing, account, or assessment that is greater than one thousand dollars on or before its due date, the administrator may discontinue the employer's coverage in addition to any other remedies permitted in this chapter, and that the administrator shall not discontinue an employer's coverage pursuant to this division prior to a final adjudication regarding the employer's failure to pay such obligation, billing, account, or assessment on or before its due date.
(I) As used in divisions (G) and (H) of this section:
(1) "Employer" has the same meaning as in section 4123.01 of the Revised Code except that "employer" does not include the state, a state hospital, or a state university or college.

It shall be the duty of the bureau of workers' compensation board of directors and the administrator of workers' compensation to safeguard and maintain the solvency of the state insurance fund and all other funds specified in this chapter and Chapters 4121., 4127., and 4131. of the Revised Code. The administrator, in the exercise of the powers and discretion conferred upon the administrator in section 4123.29 of the Revised Code, shall fix and maintain, with the advice and consent of the board, for each class of occupation or industry, the lowest possible rates of premium consistent with the maintenance of a solvent state insurance fund and the creation and maintenance of a reasonable surplus, after the payment of legitimate claims for injury, occupational disease, and death that the administrator authorizes to be paid from the state insurance fund for the benefit of injured, diseased, and the dependents of killed employees. In establishing rates, the administrator shall take into account the necessity of ensuring sufficient money is set aside in the premium payment security fund to cover any defaults in premium obligations. The administrator shall observe all of the following requirements in fixing the rates of premium for the risks of occupations or industries:
(A) The administrator shall keep an accurate account of the money paid in premiums by each of the several classes of occupations or industries, and the losses on account of injuries, occupational disease, and death of employees thereof, and also keep an account of the money received from each individual employer and the amount of losses incurred against the state insurance fund on account of injuries, occupational disease, and death of the employees of the employer.
(B) A portion of the money paid into the state insurance fund shall be set aside for the creation of a surplus fund account within the state insurance fund. Any references in this chapter or in Chapter 4121., 4125., 4127., or 4131. of the Revised Code to the surplus fund, the surplus created in this division, the statutory surplus fund, or the statutory surplus of the state insurance fund are hereby deemed to be references to the surplus fund account. The administrator may transfer the portion of the state insurance fund to the surplus fund account as the administrator determines is necessary to satisfy the needs of the surplus fund account and to guarantee the solvency of the state insurance fund and the surplus fund account. In addition to all statutory authority under this chapter and Chapter 4121. of the Revised Code, the administrator has discretionary and contingency authority to make charges to the surplus fund account. The administrator shall account for all charges, whether statutory, discretionary, or contingency, that the administrator may make to the surplus fund account. A revision of basic rates shall be made annually on the first day of July.
For policy years commencing prior to July 1, 2016, revisions of basic rates for private employers shall be in accordance with the oldest four of the last five calendar years of the combined accident and occupational disease experience of the administrator in the administration of this chapter, as shown by the accounts kept as provided in this section. For a policy year commencing on or after July 1, 2016, revisions of basic rates for private employers shall be in accordance with the oldest four of the last five policy years combined accident and occupational disease experience of the administrator in the administration of this chapter, as shown by the accounts kept as provided in this section.
Revisions of basic rates for public employers shall be in accordance with the oldest four of the last five policy years of the combined accident and occupational disease experience of the administrator in the administration of this chapter, as shown by the accounts kept as provided in this section.
In revising basic rates, the administrator shall exclude the experience of employers that are no longer active if the administrator determines that the inclusion of those employers would have a significant negative impact on the remainder of the employers in a particular manual classification. The administrator shall adopt rules, with the advice and consent of the board, governing rate revisions, the object of which shall be to make an equitable distribution of losses among the several classes of occupation or industry, which rules shall be general in their application.
(C) The administrator may apply that form of rating system that the administrator finds is best calculated to merit rate or individually rate the risk more equitably, predicated upon the basis of its individual industrial accident and occupational disease experience, and may encourage and stimulate accident prevention. The administrator shall develop fixed and equitable rules controlling the rating system, which rules shall conserve to each risk the basic principles of workers' compensation insurance.
(D) The administrator, from the money paid into the state insurance fund, shall set aside into an account of the state insurance fund titled a premium payment security fund sufficient money to pay for any premiums due from an employer and uncollected.
The use of the moneys held by the premium payment security fund account is restricted to reimbursement to the state insurance fund of premiums due and uncollected.
(E) The administrator may grant discounts on premium rates for employers who meet either of the following requirements:
(1) Have not incurred a compensable injury for one year or more and who maintain an employee safety committee or similar organization or make periodic safety inspections of the workplace.
(2) Successfully complete a loss prevention program prescribed by the superintendent of the division of safety and hygiene and conducted by the division or by any other person approved by the superintendent.
(F)
(1) In determining the premium rates for the construction industry the administrator shall calculate the employers' premiums based upon the actual remuneration construction industry employees receive from construction industry employers, provided that the amount of remuneration the administrator uses in calculating the premiums shall not exceed an average weekly wage equal to one hundred fifty per cent of the statewide average weekly wage as defined in division (C) of section 4123.62 of the Revised Code.
(2) Division (F)(1) of this section shall not be construed as affecting the manner in which benefits to a claimant are awarded under this chapter.
(3) As used in division (F) of this section, "construction industry" includes any activity performed in connection with the erection, alteration, repair, replacement, renovation, installation, or demolition of any building, structure, highway, or bridge.
(G) The administrator shall not place a limit on the length of time that an employer may participate in the bureau of workers' compensation drug free workplace and workplace safety programs.

===================================================================



 

4123.343 Employing and retaining handicapped employees.
This section shall be construed liberally to the end that employers shall be encouraged to employ and retain in their employment handicapped employees as defined in this section.
(A) As used in this section, "handicapped employee" means an employee who is afflicted with or subject to any physical or mental impairment, or both, whether congenital or due to an injury or disease of such character that the impairment constitutes a handicap in obtaining employment or would constitute a handicap in obtaining reemployment if the employee should become unemployed and whose handicap is due to any of the following diseases or conditions:
(1) Epilepsy;
(2) Diabetes;
(3) Cardiac disease;
(4) Arthritis;
(5) Amputated foot, leg, arm, or hand;
(6) Loss of sight of one or both eyes or a partial loss of uncorrected vision of more than seventy-five per cent bilaterally;

(8) Cerebral palsy;
(9) Multiple sclerosis;
(10) Parkinson's disease;
(11) Cerebral vascular accident;
(12) Tuberculosis;
(13) Silicosis;
(14) Psycho-neurotic disability following treatment in a recognized medical or mental institution;
(15) Hemophilia;
(16) Chronic osteomyelitis;
(17) Ankylosis of joints;
(18) Hyper insulinism;
(19) Muscular dystrophies;
(20) Arterio-sclerosis;
(21) Thrombo-phlebitis;
(22) Varicose veins;

(25) Disability with respect to which an individual has completed a rehabilitation program conducted pursuant to sections 4121.61 to 4121.69 of the Revised Code.
(B) Under the circumstances set forth in this section all or such portion as the administrator determines of the compensation and benefits paid in any claim arising hereafter shall be charged to and paid from the statutory surplus fund created under section 4123.34 of the Revised Code and only the portion remaining shall be merit-rated or otherwise treated as part of the accident or occupational disease experience of the employer. The provisions of this section apply only in cases of death, total disability, whether temporary or permanent, and all disabilities compensated under division (B) of section 4123.57 of the Revised Code. The administrator shall adopt rules specifying the grounds upon which charges to the statutory surplus fund are to be made. The rules shall prohibit as a grounds any agreement between employer and claimant as to the merits of a claim and the amount of the charge.
(C) Any employer who has in its employ a handicapped employee is entitled, in the event the person is injured, to a determination under this section.

(1) Whenever a handicapped employee is injured or disabled or dies as the result of an injury or occupational disease sustained in the course of and arising out of a handicapped employee's employment in this state and the administrator awards compensation therefor and when it appears to the satisfaction of the administrator that the injury or occupational disease or the death resulting therefrom would not have occurred but for the pre-existing physical or mental impairment of the handicapped employee, all compensation and benefits payable on account of the disability or death shall be paid from the surplus fund.
(2) Whenever a handicapped employee is injured or disabled or dies as a result of an injury or occupational disease and the administrator finds that the injury or occupational disease would have been sustained or suffered without regard to the employee's pre-existing impairment but that the resulting disability or death was caused at least in part through aggravation of the employee's pre-existing disability, the administrator shall determine in a manner that is equitable and reasonable and based upon medical evidence the amount of disability or proportion of the cost of the death award that is attributable to the employee's pre-existing disability and the amount found shall be charged to the statutory surplus fund.
(E) The benefits and provisions of this section apply only to employers who have complied with this chapter through insurance with the state fund .
(F) No employer shall in any year receive credit under this section in an amount greater than the premium the employer paid .
(G)
An order issued by the administrator pursuant to this section is appealable under section 4123.511 of the Revised Code but is not appealable to court under section 4123.512 of the Revised Code.

--->ohio--->Ohio Statutes--->Chapter 4123: Workers' Compensation--->4123.351 Self-Insuring Employers' Guaranty Fund
===================================================================



 

4123.351 Self-insuring employers' guaranty fund.
(A) The administrator of workers' compensation shall require every self-insuring employer, including any self-insuring employer that is indemnified by a captive insurance company granted a certificate of authority under Chapter 3964. of the Revised Code, to pay a contribution, calculated under this section, to the self-insuring employers' guaranty fund established pursuant to this section. The fund shall provide for payment of compensation and benefits to employees of the self-insuring employer in order to cover any default in payment by that employer.
(B) The bureau of workers' compensation shall operate the self-insuring employers' guaranty fund for self-insuring employers. The administrator annually shall establish the contributions due from self-insuring employers for the fund at rates as low as possible but such as will assure sufficient moneys to guarantee the payment of any claims against the fund. The bureau's operation of the fund is not subject to sections 3929.10 to 3929.18 of the Revised Code or to regulation by the superintendent of insurance.
(C) If a self-insuring employer defaults, the bureau shall recover the amounts paid as a result of the default from the self-insuring employers' guaranty fund. If a self-insuring employer defaults and is in compliance with this section for the payment of contributions to the fund, such self-insuring employer is entitled to the immunity conferred by section 4123.74 of the Revised Code for any claim arising during any period the employer is in compliance with this section.
(D)
(1) There is hereby established a self-insuring employers' guaranty fund, which shall be in the custody of the treasurer of state and which shall be separate from the other funds established and administered pursuant to this chapter. The fund shall consist of contributions and other payments made by self-insuring employers under this section. All investment earnings of the fund shall be credited to the fund. The bureau shall make disbursements from the fund pursuant to this section.
(2) The administrator has the same powers to invest any of the surplus or reserve belonging to the fund as are delegated to the administrator under section 4123.44 of the Revised Code with respect to the state insurance fund. The administrator shall apply interest earned solely to the reduction of assessments for contributions from self-insuring employers and to the payments required due to defaults.
(3) If the bureau of workers' compensation board of directors determines that reinsurance of the risks of the fund is necessary to assure solvency of the fund, the board may:
(a) Enter into contracts for the purchase of reinsurance coverage of the risks of the fund with any company or agency authorized by law to issue contracts of reinsurance;
(b) Require the administrator to pay the cost of reinsurance from the fund;
(c) Include the costs of reinsurance as a liability and estimated liability of the fund.
(E) The administrator, with the advice and consent of the board, may adopt rules pursuant to Chapter 119. of the Revised Code for the implementation of this section, including a rule, notwithstanding division (C) of this section, requiring self-insuring employers to provide security in addition to the contribution to the self-insuring employers' guaranty fund required by this section. The additional security required by the rule, as the administrator determines appropriate, shall be sufficient and adequate to provide for financial assurance to meet the obligations of self-insuring employers under this chapter and Chapter 4121. of the Revised Code.
(F) The purchase of coverage under this section by self-insuring employers is valid notwithstanding the prohibitions contained in division (A) of section 4123.82 of the Revised Code and is in addition to the indemnity contracts that self-insuring employers may purchase pursuant to division (B) of section 4123.82 of the Revised Code.
(G) The administrator, on behalf of the self-insuring employers' guaranty fund, has the rights of reimbursement and subrogation and shall collect from a defaulting self-insuring employer or other liable person all amounts the administrator has paid or reasonably expects to pay from the fund on account of the defaulting self-insuring employer.
(H) The assessments for contributions, the administration of the self-insuring employers' guaranty fund, the investment of the money in the fund, and the payment of liabilities incurred by the fund do not create any liability upon the state.
Except for a gross abuse of discretion, neither the board, nor the individual members thereof, nor the administrator shall incur any obligation or liability respecting the assessments for contributions, the administration of the self-insuring employers' guaranty fund, the investment of the fund, or the payment of liabilities therefrom.

--->ohio--->Ohio Statutes--->Chapter 4123: Workers' Compensation--->4123.352 Self-Insuring Employers Evaluation Board
===================================================================



 

4123.352 Self-insuring employers evaluation board.
(A) There is hereby created the self-insuring employers evaluation board consisting of three members. The member of the industrial commission representing the public shall be a member of the self-insuring employers evaluation board and shall serve, ex officio, as chairman. The governor shall appoint the remaining two members with the advice and consent of the senate. One member shall be a member of the Ohio self-insurance association and one member shall be a representative of labor. Not more than two of the three members of the board may be of the same political party.
Of the two members originally appointed by the governor pursuant to this section, one shall serve an initial term of two years and one an initial term of four years. Thereafter, terms of office of the two members are for four years, each term ending on the same date as the original date of appointment. Any member appointed to fill a vacancy occurring prior to the expiration of the term for which his predecessor was appointed shall hold office for the remainder of such term. Any member shall continue in office subsequent to the expiration date of his term until his successor takes office, or until a period of sixty days has elapsed, whichever occurs first. A vacancy in an unexpired term shall be filled in the same manner as the original appointment. The governor may remove any member pursuant to section 3.05 of the Revised Code.
The board member who also is a member of the commission shall receive no additional compensation but shall be reimbursed for actual and necessary expenses in the performance of his duties. The two remaining members of the board shall receive per diem compensation fixed pursuant to division (J) of section 124.15 of the Revised Code and actual and necessary expenses incurred in the performance of their duties.
For administrative purposes, the board is a part of the bureau of workers' compensation, and the bureau shall furnish the board with necessary office space, staff, and supplies. The board shall meet as required by the administrator of workers' compensation.
(B) In addition to the grounds listed in section 4123.35 of the Revised Code pertaining to criteria for being granted the status as a self-insuring employer, the grounds upon which the administrator may revoke or refuse to renew the status includes failure to comply with any rules or orders of the administrator or to pay contributions to the self-insuring employers' guaranty fund established by section 4123.351 of the Revised Code, continued failure to file medical reports bearing upon the injury of the claimant, and failure to pay compensation or benefits in accordance with law in a timely manner. A deficiency in any of the grounds listed in this division is sufficient to justify the administrator's revocation or refusal to renew the employer's status as a self-insuring employer. The administrator need not revoke or refuse to renew an employer's status as a self-insuring employer if adequate corrective action is taken by the employer pursuant to division (C) of this section.
(C) The administrator shall refer to the board all complaints or allegations of misconduct against a self-insuring employer or questions as to whether a self-insuring employer continues to meet minimum standards. The board shall investigate and may order the employer to take corrective action in accordance with the schedule the board fixes. The board's determination in this regard need not be made by formal hearing but shall be issued in written form and contain the signature of at least two board members. If the board determines, after a hearing conducted pursuant to Chapter 119. of the Revised Code and the rules of the bureau, that the employer has failed to correct the deficiencies within the time fixed by the board or is otherwise in violation of this chapter, the board shall recommend to the administrator revocation of an employer's status as a self-insuring employer or such other penalty which may include, but is not limited to, probation, or a civil penalty not to exceed ten thousand dollars for each failure. A board recommendation to revoke an employer's status as a self-insuring employer shall be by unanimous vote. A recommendation for any other penalty shall be by majority vote. Where the board makes recommendations to the administrator for disciplining a self-insuring employer, the administrator promptly and fully shall implement the recommendations.

--->ohio--->Ohio Statutes--->Chapter 4123: Workers' Compensation--->4123.35 Payment of premiums by employers.
===================================================================



 

4123.35 Payment of premiums by employers.
(A) Except as provided in this section, and until the policy year commencing July 1, 2015, every private employer and every publicly owned utility shall pay semiannually in the months of January and July into the state insurance fund the amount of annual premium the administrator of workers' compensation fixes for the employment or occupation of the employer, the amount of which premium to be paid by each employer to be determined by the classifications, rules, and rates made and published by the administrator. The employer shall pay semiannually a further sum of money into the state insurance fund as may be ascertained to be due from the employer by applying the rules of the administrator.
Except as otherwise provided in this section, for a policy year commencing on or after July 1, 2015, every private employer and every publicly owned utility shall pay annually in the month of June immediately preceding the policy year into the state insurance fund the amount of estimated annual premium the administrator fixes for the employment or occupation of the employer, the amount of which estimated premium to be paid by each employer to be determined by the classifications, rules, and rates made and published by the administrator. The employer shall pay a further sum of money into the state insurance fund as may be ascertained to be due from the employer by applying the rules of the administrator. Upon receipt of the payroll report required by division (B) of section 4123.26 of the Revised Code, the administrator shall adjust the premium and assessments charged to each employer for the difference between estimated gross payrolls and actual gross payrolls, and any balance due to the administrator shall be immediately paid by the employer. Any balance due the employer shall be credited to the employer's account.
For a policy year commencing on or after July 1, 2015, each employer that is recognized by the administrator as a professional employer organization shall pay monthly into the state insurance fund the amount of premium the administrator fixes for the employer for the prior month based on the actual payroll of the employer reported pursuant to division (C) of section 4123.26 of the Revised Code.
A receipt certifying that payment has been made shall be issued to the employer by the bureau of workers' compensation. The receipt is prima-facie evidence of the payment of the premium. The administrator shall provide each employer written proof of workers' compensation coverage as is required in section 4123.83 of the Revised Code. Proper posting of the notice constitutes the employer's compliance with the notice requirement mandated in section 4123.83 of the Revised Code.
The bureau shall verify with the secretary of state the existence of all corporations and organizations making application for workers' compensation coverage and shall require every such application to include the employer's federal identification number.
A private employer who has contracted with a subcontractor is liable for the unpaid premium due from any subcontractor with respect to that part of the payroll of the subcontractor that is for work performed pursuant to the contract with the employer.
Division (A) of this section providing for the payment of premiums semiannually does not apply to any employer who was a subscriber to the state insurance fund prior to January 1, 1914, or, until July 1, 2015, who may first become a subscriber to the fund in any month other than January or July. Instead, the semiannual premiums shall be paid by those employers from time to time upon the expiration of the respective periods for which payments into the fund have been made by them. After July 1, 2015, an employer who first becomes a subscriber to the fund on any day other than the first day of July shall pay premiums according to rules adopted by the administrator, with the advice and consent of the bureau of workers' compensation board of directors, for the remainder of the policy year for which the coverage is effective.
The administrator, with the advice and consent of the board, shall adopt rules to permit employers to make periodic payments of the premium and assessment due under this division. The rules shall include provisions for the assessment of interest charges, where appropriate, and for the assessment of penalties when an employer fails to make timely premium payments. The administrator, in the rules the administrator adopts, may set an administrative fee for these periodic payments. An employer who timely pays the amounts due under this division is entitled to all of the benefits and protections of this chapter. Upon receipt of payment, the bureau shall issue a receipt to the employer certifying that payment has been made, which receipt is prima-facie evidence of payment. Workers' compensation coverage under this chapter continues uninterrupted upon timely receipt of payment under this division.
Every public employer, except public employers that are self-insuring employers under this section, shall comply with sections 4123.38 to 4123.41, and 4123.48 of the Revised Code in regard to the contribution of moneys to the public insurance fund.
(B) Employers who will abide by the rules of the administrator and who may be of sufficient financial ability to render certain the payment of compensation to injured employees or the dependents of killed employees, and the furnishing of medical, surgical, nursing, and hospital attention and services and medicines, and funeral expenses, equal to or greater than is provided for in sections 4123.52, 4123.55 to 4123.62, and 4123.64 to 4123.67 of the Revised Code, and who do not desire to insure the payment thereof or indemnify themselves against loss sustained by the direct payment thereof, upon a finding of such facts by the administrator, may be granted the privilege to pay individually compensation, and furnish medical, surgical, nursing, and hospital services and attention and funeral expenses directly to injured employees or the dependents of killed employees, thereby being granted status as a self-insuring employer. The administrator may charge employers who apply for the status as a self-insuring employer a reasonable application fee to cover the bureau's costs in connection with processing and making a determination with respect to an application.
All employers granted status as self-insuring employers shall demonstrate sufficient financial and administrative ability to assure that all obligations under this section are promptly met. The administrator shall deny the privilege where the employer is unable to demonstrate the employer's ability to promptly meet all the obligations imposed on the employer by this section.
(1) The administrator shall consider, but is not limited to, the following factors, where applicable, in determining the employer's ability to meet all of the obligations imposed on the employer by this section:
(a)
The employer has operated in this state for a minimum of two years, provided that an employer who has purchased, acquired, or otherwise succeeded to the operation of a business, or any part thereof, situated in this state that has operated for at least two years in this state, also shall qualify;
(b) Where the employer previously contributed to the state insurance fund or is a successor employer as defined by bureau rules, the amount of the buyout, as defined by bureau rules;
(c) The sufficiency of the employer's assets located in this state to insure the employer's solvency in paying compensation directly;
(d) The financial records, documents, and data, certified by a certified public accountant, necessary to provide the employer's full financial disclosure. The records, documents, and data include, but are not limited to, balance sheets and profit and loss history for the current year and previous four years.
(e) The employer's organizational plan for the administration of the workers' compensation law;
(f) The employer's proposed plan to inform employees of the change from a state fund insurer to a self-insuring employer, the procedures the employer will follow as a self-insuring employer, and the employees' rights to compensation and benefits; and
(g) The employer has either an account in a financial institution in this state, or if the employer maintains an account with a financial institution outside this state, ensures that workers' compensation checks are drawn from the same account as payroll checks or the employer clearly indicates that payment will be honored by a financial institution in this state.
The administrator may waive the requirements of division (B)(1)(a) of this section and the requirement of division (B)(l)(d) of this section that the financial records, documents, and data be certified by a certified public accountant. The administrator shall adopt rules establishing the criteria that an employer shall meet in order for the administrator to waive the requirements of divisions (B)(1)(a) and (e)(d) of this section. Such rules may require additional security of that employer pursuant to division (E) of section 4123.351 of the Revised Code.
The administrator shall not grant the status of self-insuring employer to the state, except that the administrator may grant the status of self-insuring employer to a state institution of higher education, including its hospitals, that meets the requirements of division (B)(2) of this section.
(2) When considering the application of a public employer, except for a board of county commissioners described in division (G) of section 4123.01 of the Revised Code, a board of a county hospital, or a publicly owned utility, the administrator shall verify that the public employer satisfies all of the following requirements as the requirements apply to that public employer:
(a) For the two-year period preceding application under this section, the public employer has maintained an unvoted debt capacity equal to at least two times the amount of the current annual premium established by the administrator under this chapter for that public employer for the year immediately preceding the year in which the public employer makes application under this section.
(b) For each of the two fiscal years preceding application under this section, the unreserved and undesignated year-end fund balance in the public employer's general fund is equal to at least five per cent of the public employer's general fund revenues for the fiscal year computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
(c) For the five-year period preceding application under this section, the public employer, to the extent applicable, has complied fully with the continuing disclosure requirements established in rules adopted by the United States securities and exchange commission under 17 C.F.R. 240.15c2 - 12.
(d) For the five-year period preceding application under this section, the public employer has not had its local government fund distribution withheld on account of the public employer being indebted or otherwise obligated to the state.
(e) For the five-year period preceding application under this section, the public employer has not been under a fiscal watch or fiscal emergency pursuant to section 118.023, 118.04, or 3316.03 of the Revised Code.

The administrator may adopt rules establishing the criteria that a public employer shall satisfy in order for the administrator to waive any of the requirements listed in divisions (B)(2)(a) to (j) of this section. The rules may require additional security from that employer pursuant to division (E) of section 4123.351 of the Revised Code. The administrator shall not waive any of the requirements listed in divisions (B)(2)(a) to (j) of this section for a public employer who does not satisfy the criteria established in the rules the administrator adopts.
(C) A board of county commissioners described in division (G) of section 4123.01 of the Revised Code, as an employer, that will abide by the rules of the administrator and that may be of sufficient financial ability to render certain the payment of compensation to injured employees or the dependents of killed employees, and the furnishing of medical, surgical, nursing, and hospital attention and services and medicines, and funeral expenses, equal to or greater than is provided for in sections 4123.52, 4123.55 to 4123.62, and 4123.64 to 4123.67 of the Revised Code, and that does not desire to insure the payment thereof or indemnify itself against loss sustained by the direct payment thereof, upon a finding of such facts by the administrator, may be granted the privilege to pay individually compensation, and furnish medical, surgical, nursing, and hospital services and attention and funeral expenses directly to injured employees or the dependents of killed employees, thereby being granted status as a self-insuring employer. The administrator may charge a board of county commissioners described in division (G) of section 4123.01 of the Revised Code that applies for the status as a self-insuring employer a reasonable application fee to cover the bureau's costs in connection with processing and making a determination with respect to an application. All employers granted such status shall demonstrate sufficient financial and administrative ability to assure that all obligations under this section are promptly met. The administrator shall deny the privilege where the employer is unable to demonstrate the employer's ability to promptly meet all the obligations imposed on the employer by this section. The administrator shall consider, but is not limited to, the following factors, where applicable, in determining the employer's ability to meet all of the obligations imposed on the board as an employer by this section:
(1)
The board has operated in this state for a minimum of two years;
(2) Where the board previously contributed to the state insurance fund or is a successor employer as defined by bureau rules, the amount of the buyout, as defined by bureau rules;
(3) The sufficiency of the board's assets located in this state to insure the board's solvency in paying compensation directly;
(4) The financial records, documents, and data, certified by a certified public accountant, necessary to provide the board's full financial disclosure. The records, documents, and data include, but are not limited to, balance sheets and profit and loss history for the current year and previous four years.
(5) The board's organizational plan for the administration of the workers' compensation law;
(6) The board's proposed plan to inform employees of the proposed self-insurance, the procedures the board will follow as a self-insuring employer, and the employees' rights to compensation and benefits;
(7) The board has either an account in a financial institution in this state, or if the board maintains an account with a financial institution outside this state, ensures that workers' compensation checks are drawn from the same account as payroll checks or the board clearly indicates that payment will be honored by a financial institution in this state;
(8) The board shall provide the administrator a surety bond in an amount equal to one hundred twenty-five per cent of the projected losses as determined by the administrator.
(D) The administrator shall require a surety bond from all self-insuring employers, issued pursuant to section 4123.351 of the Revised Code, that is sufficient to compel, or secure to injured employees, or to the dependents of employees killed, the payment of compensation and expenses, which shall in no event be less than that paid or furnished out of the state insurance fund in similar cases to injured employees or to dependents of killed employees whose employers contribute to the fund, except when an employee of the employer, who has suffered the loss of a hand, arm, foot, leg, or eye prior to the injury for which compensation is to be paid, and thereafter suffers the loss of any other of the members as the result of any injury sustained in the course of and arising out of the employee's employment, the compensation to be paid by the self-insuring employer is limited to the disability suffered in the subsequent injury, additional compensation, if any, to be paid by the bureau out of the surplus created by section 4123.34 of the Revised Code.
(E) In addition to the requirements of this section, the administrator shall make and publish rules governing the manner of making application and the nature and extent of the proof required to justify a finding of fact by the administrator as to granting the status of a self-insuring employer, which rules shall be general in their application, one of which rules shall provide that all self-insuring employers shall pay into the state insurance fund such amounts as are required to be credited to the surplus fund in division (B) of section 4123.34 of the Revised Code. The administrator may adopt rules establishing requirements in addition to the requirements described in division (B)(2) of this section that a public employer shall meet in order to qualify for self-insuring status.
Employers shall secure directly from the bureau central offices application forms upon which the bureau shall stamp a designating number. Prior to submission of an application, an employer shall make available to the bureau, and the bureau shall review, the information described in division (B) (1) of this section, and public employers shall make available, and the bureau shall review, the information necessary to verify whether the public employer meets the requirements listed in division (B)(2) of this section. An employer shall file the completed application forms with an application fee, which shall cover the costs of processing the application, as established by the administrator, by rule, with the bureau at least ninety days prior to the effective date of the employer's new status as a self-insuring employer. The application form is not deemed complete until all the required information is attached thereto. The bureau shall only accept applications that contain the required information.
(F) The bureau shall review completed applications within a reasonable time. If the bureau determines to grant an employer the status as a self-insuring employer, the bureau shall issue a statement, containing its findings of fact, that is prepared by the bureau and signed by the administrator. If the bureau determines not to grant the status as a self-insuring employer, the bureau shall notify the employer of the determination and require the employer to continue to pay its full premium into the state insurance fund. The administrator also shall adopt rules establishing a minimum level of performance as a criterion for granting and maintaining the status as a self-insuring employer and fixing time limits beyond which failure of the self-insuring employer to provide for the necessary medical examinations and evaluations may not delay a decision on a claim.
(G) The administrator shall adopt rules setting forth procedures for auditing the program of self-insuring employers. The bureau shall conduct the audit upon a random basis or whenever the bureau has grounds for believing that a self-insuring employer is not in full compliance with bureau rules or this chapter.
The administrator shall monitor the programs conducted by self-insuring employers, to ensure compliance with bureau requirements and for that purpose, shall develop and issue to self-insuring employers standardized forms for use by the self-insuring employer in all aspects of the self-insuring employers' direct compensation program and for reporting of information to the bureau.
The bureau shall receive and transmit to the self-insuring employer all complaints concerning any self-insuring employer. In the case of a complaint against a self-insuring employer, the administrator shall handle the complaint through the self-insurance division of the bureau. The bureau shall maintain a file by employer of all complaints received that relate to the employer. The bureau shall evaluate each complaint and take appropriate action.
The administrator shall adopt as a rule a prohibition against any self-insuring employer from harassing, dismissing, or otherwise disciplining any employee making a complaint, which rule shall provide for a financial penalty to be levied by the administrator payable by the offending self-insuring employer.
(H) For the purpose of making determinations as to whether to grant status as a self-insuring employer, the administrator may subscribe to and pay for a credit reporting service that offers financial and other business information about individual employers. The costs in connection with the bureau's subscription or individual reports from the service about an applicant may be included in the application fee charged employers under this section.
(I) A self-insuring employer that returns to the state insurance fund as a state fund employer shall provide the administrator with medical costs and indemnity costs by claim, and payroll by manual classification and year, and such other information the administrator may require. The self-insuring employer shall submit this information by dates and in a format determined by the administrator. The administrator shall develop a state fund experience modification factor for a self-insuring employer that returns to the state insurance fund based in whole or in part on the employer's self-insured experience and the information submitted.
(J) On the first day of July of each year, the administrator shall calculate separately each self-insuring employer's assessments for the safety and hygiene fund, administrative costs pursuant to section 4123.342 of the Revised Code, and for the surplus fund under division (B) of section 4123.34 of the Revised Code, on the basis of the paid compensation attributable to the individual self-insuring employer according to the following calculation:
(1) The total assessment against all self-insuring employers as a class for each fund and for the administrative costs for the year that the assessment is being made, as determined by the administrator, divided by the total amount of paid compensation for the previous calendar year attributable to all amenable self-insuring employers;
(2) Multiply the quotient in division (J)(l) of this section by the total amount of paid compensation for the previous calendar year that is attributable to the individual self-insuring employer for whom the assessment is being determined. Each self-insuring employer shall pay the assessment that results from this calculation, unless the assessment resulting from this calculation falls below a minimum assessment, which minimum assessment the administrator shall determine on the first day of July of each year with the advice and consent of the bureau of workers' compensation board of directors, in which event, the self-insuring employer shall pay the minimum assessment.
In determining the total amount due for the total assessment against all self-insuring employers as a class for each fund and the administrative assessment, the administrator shall reduce proportionately the total for each fund and assessment by the amount of money in the self-insurance assessment fund as of the date of the computation of the assessment.
The administrator shall calculate the assessment for the portion of the surplus fund under division (B) of section 4123.34 of the Revised Code that is used for reimbursement to a self-insuring employer under division (H) of section 4123.512 of the Revised Code in the same manner as set forth in divisions (J)(l) and (2) of this section except that the administrator shall calculate the total assessment for this portion of the surplus fund only on the basis of those self-insuring employers that retain participation in reimbursement to the self-insuring employer under division (H) of section 4123.512 of the Revised Code and the individual self-insuring employer's proportion of paid compensation shall be calculated only for those self-insuring employers who retain participation in reimbursement to the self-insuring employer under division (H) of section 4123.512 of the Revised Code.
An employer who no longer is a self-insuring employer in this state or who no longer is operating in this state, shall continue to pay assessments for administrative costs and for the surplus fund under division (B) of section 4123.34 of the Revised Code based upon paid compensation attributable to claims that occurred while the employer was a self-insuring employer within this state.
(K) There is hereby created in the state treasury the self-insurance assessment fund. All investment earnings of the fund shall be deposited in the fund. The administrator shall use the money in the self-insurance assessment fund only for administrative costs as specified in section 4123.341 of the Revised Code.
(L) Every self-insuring employer shall certify, in affidavit form subject to the penalty for perjury, to the bureau the amount of the self-insuring employer's paid compensation for the previous calendar year. In reporting paid compensation paid for the previous year, a self-insuring employer shall exclude from the total amount of paid compensation any reimbursement the self-insuring employer receives in the previous calendar year from the surplus fund pursuant to section 4123.512 of the Revised Code for any paid compensation. The self-insuring employer also shall exclude from the paid compensation reported any amount recovered under section 4123.931 of the Revised Code and any amount that is determined not to have been payable to or on behalf of a claimant in any final administrative or judicial proceeding. The self-insuring employer shall exclude such amounts from the paid compensation reported in the reporting period subsequent to the date the determination is made. The administrator shall adopt rules, in accordance with Chapter 119. of the Revised Code, that provide for all of the following:
(1) Establishing the date by which self-insuring employers must submit such information and the amount of the assessments provided for in division (J) of this section for employers who have been granted self-insuring status within the last calendar year;
(2) If an employer fails to pay the assessment when due, the administrator may add a late fee penalty of not more than five hundred dollars to the assessment plus an additional penalty amount as follows:
(a) For an assessment from sixty-one to ninety days past due, the prime interest rate, multiplied by the assessment due;
(b) For an assessment from ninety-one to one hundred twenty days past due, the prime interest rate plus two per cent, multiplied by the assessment due;
(c) For an assessment from one hundred twenty-one to one hundred fifty days past due, the prime interest rate plus four per cent, multiplied by the assessment due;
(d) For an assessment from one hundred fifty-one to one hundred eighty days past due, the prime interest rate plus six per cent, multiplied by the assessment due;
(e) For an assessment from one hundred eighty-one to two hundred ten days past due, the prime interest rate plus eight per cent, multiplied by the assessment due;
(f) For each additional thirty-day period or portion thereof that an assessment remains past due after it has remained past due for more than two hundred ten days, the prime interest rate plus eight per cent, multiplied by the assessment due.
(3) An employer may appeal a late fee penalty and penalty assessment to the administrator.
For purposes of division (L)(2) of this section, "prime interest rate" means the average bank prime rate, and the administrator shall determine the prime interest rate in the same manner as a county auditor determines the average bank prime rate under section 929.02 of the Revised Code.
The administrator shall include any assessment and penalties that remain unpaid for previous assessment periods in the calculation and collection of any assessments due under this division or division (J) of this section.
(M) As used in this section, "paid compensation" means all amounts paid by a self-insuring employer for living maintenance benefits, all amounts for compensation paid pursuant to sections 4121.63, 4121.67, 4123.56, 4123.57, 4123.58, 4123.59, 4123.60, and 4123.64 of the Revised Code, all amounts paid as wages in lieu of such compensation, all amounts paid in lieu of such compensation under a nonoccupational accident and sickness program fully funded by the self-insuring employer, and all amounts paid by a self-insuring employer for a violation of a specific safety standard pursuant to Section 35 of Article II, Ohio Constitution and section 4121.47 of the Revised Code.
(N) Should any section of this chapter or Chapter 4121. of the Revised Code providing for self-insuring employers' assessments based upon compensation paid be declared unconstitutional by a final decision of any court, then that section of the Revised Code declared unconstitutional shall revert back to the section in existence prior to November 3, 1989, providing for assessments based upon payroll.
(O) The administrator may grant a self-insuring employer the privilege to self-insure a construction project entered into by the self-insuring employer that is scheduled for completion within six years after the date the project begins, and the total cost of which is estimated to exceed one hundred million dollars or, for employers described in division (R) of this section, if the construction project is estimated to exceed twenty-five million dollars. The administrator may waive such cost and time criteria and grant a self-insuring employer the privilege to self-insure a construction project regardless of the time needed to complete the construction project and provided that the cost of the construction project is estimated to exceed fifty million dollars. A self-insuring employer who desires to self-insure a construction project shall submit to the administrator an application listing the dates the construction project is scheduled to begin and end, the estimated cost of the construction project, the contractors and subcontractors whose employees are to be self-insured by the self-insuring employer, the provisions of a safety program that is specifically designed for the construction project, and a statement as to whether a collective bargaining agreement governing the rights, duties, and obligations of each of the parties to the agreement with respect to the construction project exists between the self-insuring employer and a labor organization.
A self-insuring employer may apply to self-insure the employees of either of the following:
(1) All contractors and subcontractors who perform labor or work or provide materials for the construction project;
(2) All contractors and, at the administrator's discretion, a substantial number of all the subcontractors who perform labor or work or provide materials for the construction project.
Upon approval of the application, the administrator shall mail a certificate granting the privilege to self-insure the construction project to the self-insuring employer. The certificate shall contain the name of the self-insuring employer and the name, address, and telephone number of the self-insuring employer's representatives who are responsible for administering workers' compensation claims for the construction project. The self-insuring employer shall post the certificate in a conspicuous place at the site of the construction project.
The administrator shall maintain a record of the contractors and subcontractors whose employees are covered under the certificate issued to the self-insured employer. A self-insuring employer immediately shall notify the administrator when any contractor or subcontractor is added or eliminated from inclusion under the certificate.
Upon approval of the application, the self-insuring employer is responsible for the administration and payment of all claims under this chapter and Chapter 4121. of the Revised Code for the employees of the contractor and subcontractors covered under the certificate who receive injuries or are killed in the course of and arising out of employment on the construction project, or who contract an occupational disease in the course of employment on the construction project. For purposes of this chapter and Chapter 4121. of the Revised Code, a claim that is administered and paid in accordance with this division is considered a claim against the self-insuring employer listed in the certificate. A contractor or subcontractor included under the certificate shall report to the self-insuring employer listed in the certificate, all claims that arise under this chapter and Chapter 4121. of the Revised Code in connection with the construction project for which the certificate is issued.
A self-insuring employer who complies with this division is entitled to the protections provided under this chapter and Chapter 4121. of the Revised Code with respect to the employees of the contractors and subcontractors covered under a certificate issued under this division for death or injuries that arise out of, or death, injuries, or occupational diseases that arise in the course of, those employees' employment on that construction project, as if the employees were employees of the self-insuring employer, provided that the self-insuring employer also complies with this section. No employee of the contractors and subcontractors covered under a certificate issued under this division shall be considered the employee of the self-insuring employer listed in that certificate for any purposes other than this chapter and Chapter 4121. of the Revised Code. Nothing in this division gives a self-insuring employer authority to control the means, manner, or method of employment of the employees of the contractors and subcontractors covered under a certificate issued under this division.
The contractors and subcontractors included under a certificate issued under this division are entitled to the protections provided under this chapter and Chapter 4121. of the Revised Code with respect to the contractor's or subcontractor's employees who are employed on the construction project which is the subject of the certificate, for death or injuries that arise out of, or death, injuries, or occupational diseases that arise in the course of, those employees' employment on that construction project.
The contractors and subcontractors included under a certificate issued under this division shall identify in their payroll records the employees who are considered the employees of the self-insuring employer listed in that certificate for purposes of this chapter and Chapter 4121. of the Revised Code, and the amount that those employees earned for employment on the construction project that is the subject of that certificate. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary under this chapter and Chapter 4121. of the Revised Code, the administrator shall exclude the payroll that is reported for employees who are considered the employees of the self-insuring employer listed in that certificate, and that the employees earned for employment on the construction project that is the subject of that certificate, when determining those contractors' or subcontractors' premiums or assessments required under this chapter and Chapter 4121. of the Revised Code. A self-insuring employer issued a certificate under this division shall include in the amount of paid compensation it reports pursuant to division (L) of this section, the amount of paid compensation the self-insuring employer paid pursuant to this division for the previous calendar year.
Nothing in this division shall be construed as altering the rights of employees under this chapter and Chapter 4121. of the Revised Code as those rights existed prior to September 17, 1996. Nothing in this division shall be construed as altering the rights devolved under sections 2305.31 and 4123.82 of the Revised Code as those rights existed prior to September 17, 1996.
As used in this division, "privilege to self-insure a construction project" means privilege to pay individually compensation, and to furnish medical, surgical, nursing, and hospital services and attention and funeral expenses directly to injured employees or the dependents of killed employees.
(P) A self-insuring employer whose application is granted under division (O) of this section shall designate a safety professional to be responsible for the administration and enforcement of the safety program that is specifically designed for the construction project that is the subject of the application.
A self-insuring employer whose application is granted under division (O) of this section shall employ an ombudsperson for the construction project that is the subject of the application. The ombudsperson shall have experience in workers' compensation or the construction industry, or both. The ombudsperson shall perform all of the following duties:
(1) Communicate with and provide information to employees who are injured in the course of, or whose injury arises out of employment on the construction project, or who contract an occupational disease in the course of employment on the construction project;
(2) Investigate the status of a claim upon the request of an employee to do so;
(3) Provide information to claimants, third party administrators, employers, and other persons to assist those persons in protecting their rights under this chapter and Chapter 4121. of the Revised Code.
A self-insuring employer whose application is granted under division (O) of this section shall post the name of the safety professional and the ombudsperson and instructions for contacting the safety professional and the ombudsperson in a conspicuous place at the site of the construction project.
(Q) The administrator may consider all of the following when deciding whether to grant a self-insuring employer the privilege to self-insure a construction project as provided under division (O) of this section:
(1) Whether the self-insuring employer has an organizational plan for the administration of the workers' compensation law;
(2) Whether the safety program that is specifically designed for the construction project provides for the safety of employees employed on the construction project, is applicable to all contractors and subcontractors who perform labor or work or provide materials for the construction project, and has as a component, a safety training program that complies with standards adopted pursuant to the "Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970," 84 Stat. 1590, 29 U.S.C.A. 651, and provides for continuing management and employee involvement;
(3) Whether granting the privilege to self-insure the construction project will reduce the costs of the construction project;
(4) Whether the self-insuring employer has employed an ombudsperson as required under division (P) of this section;
(5) Whether the self-insuring employer has sufficient surety to secure the payment of claims for which the self-insuring employer would be responsible pursuant to the granting of the privilege to self-insure a construction project under division (O) of this section.
(R) As used in divisions (O), (P), and (Q), "self-insuring employer" includes the following employers, whether or not they have been granted the status of being a self-insuring employer under division (B) of this section:

===================================================================



 

4123.37 Failure to pay premiums by amenable employer.
In this section "amenable employer" has the same meaning as "employer" as defined in division (I) of section 4123.32 of the Revised Code.
If the administrator of workers' compensation finds that any person, firm, or private corporation, including any public service corporation, is, or has been at any time after January 1, 1923, an amenable employer and has not complied with section 4123.35 of the Revised Code the administrator shall determine the period during which the person, firm, or corporation was an amenable employer and shall forthwith give notice of the determination to the employer. Within twenty days thereafter the employer shall furnish the bureau with the payroll covering the period included in the determination and, if the employer is an amenable employer at the time of the determination, shall pay into the state insurance fund the amount of premium and assessments applicable to such payroll. If the administrator determines that the employer is an amenable employer prior to the policy year commencing July 1, 2015, the administrator may require the employer to pay a premium security deposit.
If the employer does not furnish the payroll and pay the applicable premium, assessments, and, if applicable, the premium security deposit within the twenty days, the administrator shall forthwith make an assessment of the amounts due from the employer for the period the administrator determined the employer to be an amenable employer if the employer is an amenable employer at the time of the determination, basing the assessment upon the information in the possession of the administrator.
The administrator shall give to the employer assessed written notice of the assessment. The notice shall be mailed to the employer at the employer's residence or usual place of business by certified mail. Unless the employer to whom the notice of assessment is directed files with the bureau within twenty days after receipt thereof, a petition in writing, verified under oath by the employer, or the employer's authorized agent having knowledge of the facts, setting forth with particularity the items of the assessment objected to, together with the reason for the objections, the assessment shall become conclusive and the amount thereof shall be due and payable from the employer so assessed to the state insurance fund. When a petition objecting to an assessment is filed the bureau shall assign a time and place for the hearing of the same and shall notify the petitioner thereof by certified mail. When an employer files a petition the assessment made by the administrator shall become due and payable ten days after notice of the finding made at the hearing has been sent by certified mail to the party assessed. An appeal may be taken from any finding to the court of common pleas of Franklin county upon the execution by the party assessed of a bond to the state in double the amount found due and ordered paid by the bureau conditioned that the party will pay any judgment and costs rendered against it for the premium.
When no petition objecting to an assessment is filed or when a finding is made affirming or modifying an assessment after hearing, a certified copy of the assessment as affirmed or modified may be filed by the administrator in the office of the clerk of the court of common pleas in any county in which the employer has property or in which the employer has a place of business. The clerk, immediately upon the filing of the assessment, shall enter a judgment for the state against the employer in the amount shown on the assessment. The judgment may be filed by the clerk in a loose leaf book entitled "special judgments for state insurance fund." The judgment shall bear the same rate of interest, have the same effect as other judgments, and be given the same preference allowed by law on other judgments rendered for claims for taxes. An assessment or judgment under this section shall not be a bar to the adjustment of the employer's account upon the employer furnishing the employer's payroll records to the bureau.
The administrator, for good cause shown, may waive a default in the payment of premium where the default is of less than sixty days' duration, and upon payment by the employer of the premium for the period, the employer and the employer's employees are entitled to all of the benefits and immunities provided by this chapter.

In fixing the amount of contribution to be made by the county, for such county and for the taxing districts therein, the administrator shall classify counties and other taxing districts into such groups as will equitably determine the contributions in accordance with the relative degree of hazard, and also merit rate such individual counties, taxing districts, or groups of taxing districts in accordance with their individual accident experience so as ultimately to provide for each taxing subdivision contributing an amount sufficient to meet its individual obligations and to maintain a solvent public insurance fund.

The administrator shall classify hospitals owned by a political subdivision or subdivisions as a group and merit rate each individual hospital according to its individual accident experience as provided in the rules of the administrator.
A children's home or other such public institution, or any other public activity maintained and operated by two or more counties or parts of counties, shall be considered as a county for the purpose of this chapter.
The contribution to the state insurance fund of the state and its departments, agencies, and instrumentalities shall be paid from appropriations made by the general assembly for that purpose.
The administrator shall develop and make available to counties and taxing districts and the district activities and institutions mentioned in this section a plan that groups, for rating purposes, counties, districts, and such activities and institutions of similar size and risk, and pools the risks of those counties, districts, activities, and institutions within the group. In no event shall this be construed as granting to such counties, districts, activities, or institutions status as self-insuring employers.

(A) For all injuries and disabilities occurring before January 1, 1987, the administrator of workers' compensation, for the purpose of carrying out sections 4123.412 to 4123.418 of the Revised Code and with the advice and consent of the bureau of workers' compensation board of directors, may levy an assessment against all employers at a rate not to exceed ten cents per one hundred dollars of payroll. If the administrator levies an assessment under this division, the rate of that assessment shall be determined annually for each employer group listed in divisions (A)(1) to (3) of this section. The rates determined under this division shall be sufficient to produce an amount no greater than the amount the administrator estimates to be necessary to carry out such sections for the period for which the assessment is levied. In the event the amount produced by the assessment is not sufficient to carry out such sections the additional amount necessary shall be provided, pursuant to section 4123.419 of the Revised Code, from the income produced as a result of investments made pursuant to section 4123.44 of the Revised Code.
If levied, assessments shall be according to the following schedule:
(1) For private fund employers, except self-insuring employers:
(a) For policy years commencing prior to July 1, 2015, in January and July of each year upon gross payrolls of the preceding six months;
(b) For policy years commencing on or after July 1, 2015, in the month of June immediately preceding each policy year upon gross payrolls estimated for that policy year.
(2) For counties and taxing district employers therein, except county hospitals that are self-insuring employers:
(a) For policy years commencing prior to January 1, 2016, in January of each year upon gross payrolls of the preceding twelve months;
(b) For policy years commencing on or after January 1, 2016, in the month of December immediately preceding each policy year upon gross payrolls estimated for that policy year.
(3) For the state as an employer--in January, April, July, and October of each year upon gross payrolls of the preceding three months or at other intervals as the administrator establishes.
After the completion of each policy year that commences on or after July 1, 2015, for private fund employers or that commences on or after January 1, 2016, for counties and taxing district employers therein, the assessments levied under this section shall be adjusted for the difference between estimated gross payrolls and actual gross payrolls reported by the employer on the payroll report submitted by a private employer pursuant to section 4123.26 of the Revised Code, or, for a public employer, submitted pursuant to section 4123.41 of the Revised Code.
Amounts assessed in accordance with this section shall be collected from each employer as prescribed in rules the administrator adopts.
The moneys derived from the assessment provided for in this section shall be credited to the disabled workers' relief fund created by section 4123.412 of the Revised Code. The administrator shall establish by rule classifications of employers within divisions (A)(1) to (3) of this section and shall determine rates for each class so as to fairly apportion the costs of carrying out sections 4123.412 to 4123.418 of the Revised Code.
(B) For all injuries and disabilities occurring on or after January 1, 1987, the administrator, for the purposes of carrying out sections 4123.412 to 4123.418 of the Revised Code, shall levy an assessment against all employers at a rate per one hundred dollars of payroll, such rate to be determined annually for each classification of employer in each employer group listed in divisions (A)(1) to (3) of this section, which will produce an amount no greater than the amount the administrator estimates to be necessary to carry out such sections for the period for which the assessment is levied. The administrator annually shall establish the contributions due from employers for the disabled workers' relief fund at rates as low as possible but that will assure sufficient moneys to guarantee the payment of any claims against that fund.
Amounts assessed in accordance with this division shall be billed at the same time premiums are billed and credited to the disabled workers' relief fund created by section 4123.412 of the Revised Code. The administrator shall determine the rates for each class in the same manner as the administrator fixes the rates for premiums pursuant to section 4123.29 of the Revised Code.
(C) For a self-insuring employer, the bureau of workers' compensation shall pay to employees who are participants regardless of the date of injury, any amounts due to the participants under section 4123.414 of the Revised Code and shall bill the self-insuring employer, semiannually, for all amounts paid to a participant.

The administrator shall not change the date of maturity of any part of the principal or interest of any bond issue, nor shall he require a bond of any issue to be of a larger denomination, nor any partial payment of principal to be of greater amount than the aggregate amount of the issue falling due at any date.

If the bureau receives from a person other than the claimant written or facsimile information or information communicated verbally over the telephone indicating that an injury or occupational disease has occurred or been contracted which may be compensable under this chapter, the bureau shall notify the employee and the employer of the information. If the information is provided verbally over the telephone, the person providing the information shall provide written verification of the information to the bureau according to division (E) of section 4123.84 of the Revised Code. The receipt of the information in writing or facsimile, or if initially by telephone, the subsequent written verification, and the notice by the bureau shall be considered an application for compensation under section 4123.84 or 4123.85 of the Revised Code, provided that the conditions of division (E) of section 4123.84 of the Revised Code apply to information provided verbally over the telephone. Upon receipt of a claim, the bureau shall advise the claimant of the claim number assigned and the claimant's right to representation in the processing of a claim or to elect no representation.

The employer and claimant may waive, in writing, their rights to an appeal under this division.
(2) Notwithstanding the time limitation specified in division (B)(1) of this section for the issuance of an order, if the employer certifies a claim for payment of compensation or benefits, or both, to a claimant, and the administrator has completed the investigation of the claim, the payment of benefits or compensation, or both, as is appropriate, shall commence upon the later of the date of the certification or completion of the investigation and issuance of the order by the administrator, provided that the administrator shall issue the order no later than the time limitation specified in division (B)(1) of this section.
(3) If an appeal is made under division (B)(1) or (2) of this section, the administrator shall forward the claim file to the appropriate district hearing officer within seven days of the appeal. In contested claims other than state fund claims, the administrator shall forward the claim within seven days of the administrator's receipt of the claim to the industrial commission, which shall refer the claim to an appropriate district hearing officer for a hearing in accordance with division (C) of this section.
(C) If an employer or claimant timely appeals the order of the administrator issued under division (B) of this section or in the case of other contested claims other than state fund claims, the commission shall refer the claim to an appropriate district hearing officer according to rules the commission adopts under section 4121.36 of the Revised Code.

The staff hearing officer shall notify the parties and their respective representatives in writing of the staff hearing officer's order. Any party may appeal an order issued under this division pursuant to division (E) of this section within fourteen days after receipt of the order under this division.
(E) Upon the filing of a timely appeal of the order of the staff hearing officer issued under division (D) of this section, the commission or a designated staff hearing officer, on behalf of the commission, shall determine whether the commission will hear the appeal. If the commission or the designated staff hearing officer decides to hear the appeal, the commission or the designated staff hearing officer shall notify the parties and their respective representatives in writing of the time and place of the hearing. The commission shall hold the hearing within forty-five days after the filing of the notice of appeal and, within seven days after the conclusion of the hearing, the commission shall issue its order affirming, modifying, or reversing the order issued under division (D) of this section. The commission shall notify the parties and their respective representatives in writing of the order. If the commission or the designated staff hearing officer determines not to hear the appeal, within fourteen days after the expiration of the period in which an appeal of the order of the staff hearing officer may be filed as provided in division (D) of this section, the commission or the designated staff hearing officer shall issue an order to that effect and notify the parties and their respective representatives in writing of that order.
Except as otherwise provided in this chapter and Chapters 4121., 4127., and 4131. of the Revised Code, any party may appeal an order issued under this division to the court pursuant to section 4123.512 of the Revised Code within sixty days after receipt of the order, subject to the limitations contained in that section.

However, in cases in which the employer is represented, the administrator shall neither present arguments nor introduce testimony that is cumulative to that presented or introduced by the employer or the employer's representative. The administrator may file an appeal under this section on behalf of the state insurance fund; however, except in cases arising under section 4123.343 of the Revised Code, the administrator only may appeal questions of law or issues of fraud when the employer appears in person or by representative.
(H) Except as provided in section 4121.63 of the Revised Code and division (K) of this section, payments of compensation to a claimant or on behalf of a claimant as a result of any order issued under this chapter shall commence upon the earlier of the following:

(K) Upon the final administrative or judicial determination under this section or section 4123.512 of the Revised Code of an appeal of an order to pay compensation, if a claimant is found to have received compensation pursuant to a prior order which is reversed upon subsequent appeal, the claimant's employer, if a self-insuring employer, or the bureau, shall withhold from any amount to which the claimant becomes entitled pursuant to any claim, past, present, or future, under Chapter 4121., 4123., 4127., or 4131. of the Revised Code, the amount of previously paid compensation to the claimant which, due to reversal upon appeal, the claimant is not entitled, pursuant to the following criteria:

The administrator and self-insuring employers are not subject to, but may utilize, the repayment schedule of this division, or any other lawful means, to collect payment of compensation made to a person who was not entitled to the compensation due to fraud as determined by the administrator or the industrial commission.
(L) If a staff hearing officer or the commission fails to issue a decision or the commission fails to refuse to hear an appeal within the time periods required by this section, payments to a claimant shall cease until the staff hearing officer or commission issues a decision or hears the appeal, unless the failure was due to the fault or neglect of the employer or the employer agrees that the payments should continue for a longer period of time.
(M) Except as otherwise provided in this section or section 4123.522 of the Revised Code, no appeal is timely filed under this section unless the appeal is filed with the time limits set forth in this section.

--->ohio--->Ohio Statutes--->Chapter 4123: Workers' Compensation--->4123.512 Appeal to court
===================================================================



 

4123.512 Appeal to court.
(A) The claimant or the employer may appeal an order of the industrial commission made under division (E) of section 4123.511 of the Revised Code in any injury or occupational disease case, other than a decision as to the extent of disability to the court of common pleas of the county in which the injury was inflicted or in which the contract of employment was made if the injury occurred outside the state, or in which the contract of employment was made if the exposure occurred outside the state. If no common pleas court has jurisdiction for the purposes of an appeal by the use of the jurisdictional requirements described in this division, the appellant may use the venue provisions in the Rules of Civil Procedure to vest jurisdiction in a court. If the claim is for an occupational disease, the appeal shall be to the court of common pleas of the county in which the exposure which caused the disease occurred. Like appeal may be taken from an order of a staff hearing officer made under division (D) of section 4123.511 of the Revised Code from which the commission has refused to hear an appeal. The appellant shall file the notice of appeal with a court of common pleas within sixty days after the date of the receipt of the order appealed from or the date of receipt of the order of the commission refusing to hear an appeal of a staff hearing officer's decision under division (D) of section 4123.511 of the Revised Code. The filing of the notice of the appeal with the court is the only act required to perfect the appeal.
If an action has been commenced in a court of a county other than a court of a county having jurisdiction over the action, the court, upon notice by any party or upon its own motion, shall transfer the action to a court of a county having jurisdiction.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this section, if the commission determines under section 4123.522 of the Revised Code that an employee, employer, or their respective representatives have not received written notice of an order or decision which is appealable to a court under this section and which grants relief pursuant to section 4123.522 of the Revised Code, the party granted the relief has sixty days from receipt of the order under section 4123.522 of the Revised Code to file a notice of appeal under this section.
(B) The notice of appeal shall state the names of the administrator of workers' compensation, the claimant, and the employer; the number of the claim; the date of the order appealed from; and the fact that the appellant appeals therefrom.
The administrator, the claimant, and the employer shall be parties to the appeal and the court, upon the application of the commission, shall make the commission a party. The party filing the appeal shall serve a copy of the notice of appeal on the administrator at the central office of the bureau of workers' compensation in Columbus. The administrator shall notify the employer that if the employer fails to become an active party to the appeal, then the administrator may act on behalf of the employer and the results of the appeal could have an adverse effect upon the employer's premium rates or may result in a recovery from the employer if the employer is determined to be a noncomplying employer under section 4123.75 of the Revised Code.
(C) The attorney general or one or more of the attorney general's assistants or special counsel designated by the attorney general shall represent the administrator and the commission. In the event the attorney general or the attorney general's designated assistants or special counsel are absent, the administrator or the commission shall select one or more of the attorneys in the employ of the administrator or the commission as the administrator's attorney or the commission's attorney in the appeal. Any attorney so employed shall continue the representation during the entire period of the appeal and in all hearings thereof except where the continued representation becomes impractical.
(D) Upon receipt of notice of appeal, the clerk of courts shall provide notice to all parties who are appellees and to the commission.
The claimant shall, within thirty days after the filing of the notice of appeal, file a petition containing a statement of facts in ordinary and concise language showing a cause of action to participate or to continue to participate in the fund and setting forth the basis for the jurisdiction of the court over the action. Further pleadings shall be had in accordance with the Rules of Civil Procedure, provided that service of summons on such petition shall not be required and provided that the claimant may not dismiss the complaint without the employer's consent if the employer is the party that filed the notice of appeal to court pursuant to this section. The clerk of the court shall, upon receipt thereof, transmit by certified mail a copy thereof to each party named in the notice of appeal other than the claimant. Any party may file with the clerk prior to the trial of the action a deposition of any physician taken in accordance with the provisions of the Revised Code, which deposition may be read in the trial of the action even though the physician is a resident of or subject to service in the county in which the trial is had. The bureau of workers' compensation shall pay the cost of the stenographic deposition filed in court and of copies of the stenographic deposition for each party from the surplus fund and charge the costs thereof against the unsuccessful party if the claimant's right to participate or continue to participate is finally sustained or established in the appeal. In the event the deposition is taken and filed, the physician whose deposition is taken is not required to respond to any subpoena issued in the trial of the action. The court, or the jury under the instructions of the court, if a jury is demanded, shall determine the right of the claimant to participate or to continue to participate in the fund upon the evidence adduced at the hearing of the action.
(E) The court shall certify its decision to the commission and the certificate shall be entered in the records of the court. Appeals from the judgment are governed by the law applicable to the appeal of civil actions.
(F) The cost of any legal proceedings authorized by this section, including an attorney's fee to the claimant's attorney to be fixed by the trial judge, based upon the effort expended, in the event the claimant's right to participate or to continue to participate in the fund is established upon the final determination of an appeal, shall be taxed against the employer or the commission if the commission or the administrator rather than the employer contested the right of the claimant to participate in the fund. The attorney's fee shall not exceed forty-two hundred dollars.
(G) If the finding of the court or the verdict of the jury is in favor of the claimant's right to participate in the fund, the commission and the administrator shall thereafter proceed in the matter of the claim as if the judgment were the decision of the commission, subject to the power of modification provided by section 4123.52 of the Revised Code.
(H)
(1) An appeal from an order issued under division (E) of section 4123.511 of the Revised Code or any action filed in court in a case in which an award of compensation or medical benefits has been made shall not stay the payment of compensation or medical benefits under the award, or payment for subsequent periods of total disability or medical benefits during the pendency of the appeal. If, in a final administrative or judicial action, it is determined that payments of compensation or benefits, or both, made to or on behalf of a claimant should not have been made, the amount thereof shall be charged to the surplus fund account under division (B) of section 4123.34 of the Revised Code. In the event the employer is a state risk, the amount shall not be charged to the employer's experience, and the administrator shall adjust the employer's account accordingly. In the event the employer is a self-insuring employer, the self-insuring employer shall deduct the amount from the paid compensation the self-insuring employer reports to the administrator under division (L) of section 4123.35 of the Revised Code. If an employer is a state risk and has paid an assessment for a violation of a specific safety requirement, and, in a final administrative or judicial action, it is determined that the employer did not violate the specific safety requirement, the administrator shall reimburse the employer from the surplus fund account under division (B) of section 4123.34 of the Revised Code for the amount of the assessment the employer paid for the violation.
(2)
(a) Notwithstanding a final determination that payments of benefits made to or on behalf of a claimant should not have been made, the administrator or self-insuring employer shall award payment of medical or vocational rehabilitation services submitted for payment after the date of the final determination if all of the following apply:
(i) The services were approved and were rendered by the provider in good faith prior to the date of the final determination.
(ii) The services were payable under division (I) of section 4123.511 of the Revised Code prior to the date of the final determination.
(iii) The request for payment is submitted within the time limit set forth in section 4123.52 of the Revised Code.
(b) Payments made under division (H)(1) of this section shall be charged to the surplus fund account under division (B) of section 4123.34 of the Revised Code. If the employer of the employee who is the subject of a claim described in division (H)(2)(a) of this section is a state fund employer, the payments made under that division shall not be charged to the employer's experience. If that employer is a self-insuring employer, the self-insuring employer shall deduct the amount from the paid compensation the self-insuring employer reports to the administrator under division (L) of section 4123.35 of the Revised Code.
(c) Division (H)(2) of this section shall apply only to a claim under this chapter or Chapter 4121., 4127., or 4131. of the Revised Code arising on or after July 29, 2011.

(A) The jurisdiction of the industrial commission and the authority of the administrator of workers' compensation over each case is continuing, and the commission may make such modification or change with respect to former findings or orders with respect thereto, as, in its opinion is justified. No modification or change nor any finding or award in respect of any claim shall be made with respect to disability, compensation, dependency, or benefits, after five years from the date of injury in the absence of the payment of medical benefits under this chapter or in the absence of payment of compensation under section 4123.57, 4123.58, or division (A) or (B) of section 4123.56 of the Revised Code or wages in lieu of compensation in a manner so as to satisfy the requirements of section 4123.84 of the Revised Code, in which event the modification, change, finding, or award shall be made within five years from the date of the last payment of compensation or from the date of death, nor unless written notice of claim for the specific part or parts of the body injured or disabled has been given as provided in section 4123.84 or 4123.85 of the Revised Code.

4123.53 Medical examinations - vocational evaluation or questionnaire.
(A) The administrator of workers' compensation or the industrial commission may require any employee claiming the right to receive compensation to submit to a medical examination, vocational evaluation, or vocational questionnaire at any time, and from time to time, at a place reasonably convenient for the employee, and as provided by the rules of the commission or the administrator of workers' compensation. A claimant required by the commission or administrator to submit to a medical examination or vocational evaluation, at a point outside of the place of permanent or temporary residence of the claimant, as provided in this section, is entitled to have paid to the claimant by the bureau of workers' compensation the necessary and actual expenses on account of the attendance for the medical examination or vocational evaluation after approval of the expense statement by the bureau. Under extraordinary circumstances and with the unanimous approval of the commission, if the commission requires the medical examination or vocational evaluation, or with the approval of the administrator, if the administrator requires the medical examination or vocational evaluation, the bureau shall pay an injured or diseased employee the necessary, actual, and authorized expenses of treatment at a point outside the place of permanent or temporary residence of the claimant.
(B) When an employee initially receives temporary total disability compensation pursuant to section 4123.56 of the Revised Code for a consecutive ninety-day period, the administrator shall refer the employee to the bureau medical section for a medical examination to determine the employee's continued entitlement to such compensation, the employee's rehabilitation potential, and the appropriateness of the medical treatment the employee is receiving. The bureau medical section shall conduct the examination not later than thirty days following the end of the initial ninety-day period. If the medical examiner, upon an initial or any subsequent examination recommended by the medical examiner under this division, determines that the employee is temporarily and totally impaired, the medical examiner shall recommend a date when the employee should be reexamined. Upon the issuance of the medical examination report containing a recommendation for reexamination, the administrator shall schedule an examination and, if at the date of reexamination the employee is receiving temporary total disability compensation, the employee shall be examined. The administrator shall adopt a rule, pursuant to Chapter 119. of the Revised Code, permitting employers to waive the administrator's scheduling of any such examinations.
(C) If an employee refuses to submit to any medical examination or vocational evaluation scheduled pursuant to this section or obstructs the same, or refuses to complete and submit to the bureau or commission a vocational questionnaire within thirty days after the bureau or commission mails the request to complete and submit the questionnaire the employee's right to have his or her claim for compensation considered, if the claim is pending before the bureau or commission, or to receive any payment for compensation theretofore granted, is suspended during the period of the refusal or obstruction. Notwithstanding this section, an employee's failure to submit to a medical examination or vocational evaluation, or to complete and submit a vocational questionnaire, shall not result in the dismissal of the employee's claim.
(D) Medical examinations scheduled under this section do not limit medical examinations provided for in other provisions of this chapter or Chapter 4121. of the Revised Code.

(2) When the employee refuses to submit to a requested chemical test, on the condition that that employee is or was given notice that the refusal to submit to any chemical test described in division (B)(1) of this section may affect the employee's eligibility for compensation and benefits under this chapter and Chapter 4121. of the Revised Code.
(C)
(1) For purposes of division (B) of this section, a chemical test is a qualifying chemical test if it is administered to an employee after an injury under at least one of the following conditions:

These facts and inferences may be based on, but are not limited to, any of the following:
(a) Observable phenomena, such as direct observation of use, possession, or distribution of alcohol , a controlled substance, or marihuana, or of the physical symptoms of being under the influence of alcohol , a controlled substance, or marihuana, such as but not limited to slurred speech; dilated pupils; odor of alcohol , a controlled substance, or marihuana: changes in affect; or dynamic mood swings;

(G) If a condition that pre-existed an injury is substantially aggravated by the injury, and that substantial aggravation is documented by objective diagnostic findings, objective clinical findings, or objective test results, no compensation or benefits are payable because of the pre-existing condition once that condition has returned to a level that would have existed without the injury.
(H)
(1) Whenever, with respect to an employee of an employer who is subject to and has complied with this chapter, there is possibility of conflict with respect to the application of workers' compensation laws because the contract of employment is entered into and all or some portion of the work is or is to be performed in a state or states other than Ohio, the employer and the employee may agree to be bound by the laws of this state or by the laws of some other state in which all or some portion of the work of the employee is to be performed. The agreement shall be in writing and shall be filed with the bureau of workers' compensation within ten days after it is executed and shall remain in force until terminated or modified by agreement of the parties similarly filed. If the agreement is to be bound by the laws of this state and the employer has complied with this chapter, then the employee is entitled to compensation and benefits regardless of where the injury occurs or the disease is contracted and the rights of the employee and the employee's dependents under the laws of this state are the exclusive remedy against the employer on account of injury, disease, or death in the course of and arising out of the employee's employment. If the agreement is to be bound by the laws of another state and the employer has complied with the laws of that state, the rights of the employee and the employee's dependents under the laws of that state are the exclusive remedy against the employer on account of injury, disease, or death in the course of and arising out of the employee's employment without regard to the place where the injury was sustained or the disease contracted. If an employer and an employee enter into an agreement under this division, the fact that the employer and the employee entered into that agreement shall not be construed to change the status of an employee whose continued employment is subject to the will of the employer or the employee, unless the agreement contains a provision that expressly changes that status.
(2) If an employee or the employee's dependents receive an award of compensation or benefits under this chapter or Chapter 4121., 4127., or 4131. of the Revised Code for the same injury, occupational disease, or death for which the employee or the employee's dependents previously pursued or otherwise elected to accept workers' compensation benefits and received a decision on the merits as defined in section 4123.542 of the Revised Code under the laws of another state or recovered damages under the laws of another state, the claim shall be disallowed and the administrator or any self-insuring employer, by any lawful means, may collect from the employee or the employee's dependents any of the following:
(a) The amount of compensation or benefits paid to or on behalf of the employee or the employee's dependents by the administrator or a self-insuring employer pursuant to this chapter or Chapter 4121., 4127., or 4131. of the Revised Code for that award;
(b) Any interest, attorney's fees, and costs the administrator or the self-insuring employer incurs in collecting that payment.
(3) If an employee or the employee's dependents receive an award of compensation or benefits under this chapter or Chapter 4121., 4127., or 4131. of the Revised Code and subsequently pursue or otherwise elect to accept workers' compensation benefits or damages under the laws of another state for the same injury, occupational disease, or death the claim under this chapter or Chapter 4121., 4127., or 4131. of the Revised Code shall be disallowed. The administrator or a self-insuring employer, by any lawful means, may collect from the employee or the employee's dependents or other-states' insurer any of the following:
(a) The amount of compensation or benefits paid to or on behalf of the employee or the employee's dependents by the administrator or the self-insuring employer pursuant to this chapter or Chapter 4121., 4127., or 4131. of the Revised Code for that award;
(b) Any interest, costs, and attorney's fees the administrator or the self-insuring employer incurs in collecting that payment;
(c) Any costs incurred by an employer in contesting or responding to any claim filed by the employee or the employee's dependents for the same injury, occupational disease, or death that was filed after the original claim for which the employee or the employee's dependents received a decision on the merits as described in section 4123.542 of the Revised Code.
(4) If the employee's employer pays premiums into the state insurance fund, the administrator shall not charge the amount of compensation or benefits the administrator collects pursuant to division (H)(2) or (3) of this section to the employer's experience. If the administrator collects any costs incurred by an employer in contesting or responding to any claim pursuant to division (H)(2) or (3) of this section, the administrator shall forward the amount collected to that employer. If the employee's employer is a self-insuring employer, the self-insuring employer shall deduct the amount of compensation or benefits the self-insuring employer collects pursuant to this division from the paid compensation the self-insuring employer reports to the administrator under division (L) of section 4123.35 of the Revised Code.
(5) If an employee is a resident of a state other than this state and is insured under the workers' compensation law or similar laws of a state other than this state, the employee and the employee's dependents are not entitled to receive compensation or benefits under this chapter, on account of injury, disease, or death arising out of or in the course of employment while temporarily within this state, and the rights of the employee and the employee's dependents under the laws of the other state are the exclusive remedy against the employer on account of the injury, disease, or death.
(6) An employee, or the dependent of an employee, who elects to receive compensation and benefits under this chapter or Chapter 4121., 4127., or 4131. of the Revised Code for a claim may not receive compensation and benefits under the workers' compensation laws of any state other than this state for that same claim. For each claim submitted by or on behalf of an employee, the administrator or, if the employee is employed by a self-insuring employer, the self-insuring employer, shall request the employee or the employee's dependent to sign an election that affirms the employee's or employee's dependent's acceptance of electing to receive compensation and benefits under this chapter or Chapter 4121., 4127., or 4131. of the Revised Code for that claim that also affirmatively waives and releases the employee's or the employee's dependent's right to file for and receive compensation and benefits under the laws of any state other than this state for that claim. The employee or employee's dependent shall sign the election form within twenty-eight days after the administrator or self-insuring employer submits the request or the administrator or self-insuring employer shall dismiss that claim.
In the event a workers' compensation claim has been filed in another jurisdiction on behalf of an employee or the dependents of an employee, and the employee or dependents subsequently elect to receive compensation, benefits, or both under this chapter or Chapter 4121., 4127., or 4131. of the Revised Code, the employee or dependent shall withdraw or refuse acceptance of the workers' compensation claim filed in the other jurisdiction in order to pursue compensation or benefits under the laws of this state. If the employee or dependents were awarded workers' compensation benefits or had recovered damages under the laws of the other state, any compensation and benefits awarded under this chapter or Chapter 4121., 4127., or 4131. of the Revised Code shall be paid only to the extent to which those payments exceed the amounts paid under the laws of the other state. If the employee or dependent fails to withdraw or to refuse acceptance of the workers' compensation claim in the other jurisdiction within twenty-eight days after a request made by the administrator or a self-insuring employer, the administrator or self-insuring employer shall dismiss the employee's or employee's dependents' claim made in this state.
(I) If an employee who is covered under the federal "Longshore and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act," 98 Stat. 1639, 33 U.S.C. 901 et seq., is injured or contracts an occupational disease or dies as a result of an injury or occupational disease, and if that employee's or that employee's dependents' claim for compensation or benefits for that injury, occupational disease, or death is subject to the jurisdiction of that act, the employee or the employee's dependents are not entitled to apply for and shall not receive compensation or benefits under this chapter and Chapter 4121. of the Revised Code. The rights of such an employee and the employee's dependents under the federal "Longshore and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act," 98 Stat. 1639, 33 U.S.C. 901 et seq., are the exclusive remedy against the employer for that injury, occupational disease, or death.
(J) Compensation or benefits are not payable to a claimant during the period of confinement of the claimant in any state or federal correctional institution, or in any county jail in lieu of incarceration in a state or federal correctional institution, whether in this or any other state for conviction of violation of any state or federal criminal law.
(K) An employer, upon the approval of the administrator, may provide for workers' compensation coverage for the employer's employees who are professional athletes and coaches by submitting to the administrator proof of coverage under a league policy issued under the laws of another state under either of the following circumstances:
(1) The employer administers the payroll and workers' compensation insurance for a professional sports team subject to a collective bargaining agreement, and the collective bargaining agreement provides for the uniform administration of workers' compensation benefits and compensation for professional athletes.
(2) The employer is a professional sports league, or is a member team of a professional sports league, and all of the following apply:
(a) The professional sports league operates as a single entity, whereby all of the players and coaches of the sports league are employees of the sports league and not of the individual member teams.
(b) The professional sports league at all times maintains workers' compensation insurance that provides coverage for the players and coaches of the sports league.
(c) Each individual member team of the professional sports league, pursuant to the organizational or operating documents of the sports league, is obligated to the sports league to pay to the sports league any workers' compensation claims that are not covered by the workers' compensation insurance maintained by the sports league.
If the administrator approves the employer's proof of coverage submitted under division (K) of this section, a professional athlete or coach who is an employee of the employer and the dependents of the professional athlete or coach are not entitled to apply for and shall not receive compensation or benefits under this chapter and Chapter 4121. of the Revised Code. The rights of such an athlete or coach and the dependents of such an athlete or coach under the laws of the state where the policy was issued are the exclusive remedy against the employer for the athlete or coach if the athlete or coach suffers an injury or contracts an occupational disease in the course of employment, or for the dependents of the athlete or the coach if the athlete or coach is killed as a result of an injury or dies as a result of an occupational disease, regardless of the location where the injury was suffered or the occupational disease was contracted.

(A) Except as provided in division (D) of this section, in the case of temporary disability, an employee shall receive sixty-six and two-thirds per cent of the employee's average weekly wage so long as such disability is total, not to exceed a maximum amount of weekly compensation which is equal to the statewide average weekly wage as defined in division (C) of section 4123.62 of the Revised Code, and not less than a minimum amount of compensation which is equal to thirty-three and one-third per cent of the statewide average weekly wage as defined in division (C) of section 4123.62 of the Revised Code unless the employee's wage is less than thirty-three and one-third per cent of the minimum statewide average weekly wage, in which event the employee shall receive compensation equal to the employee's full wages; provided that for the first twelve weeks of total disability the employee shall receive seventy-two per cent of the employee's full weekly wage, but not to exceed a maximum amount of weekly compensation which is equal to the lesser of the statewide average weekly wage as defined in division (C) of section 4123.62 of the Revised Code or one hundred per cent of the employee's net take-home weekly wage. In the case of a self-insuring employer, payments shall be for a duration based upon the medical reports of the attending physician. If the employer disputes the attending physician's report, payments may be terminated only upon application and hearing by a district hearing officer pursuant to division (C) of section 4123.511 of the Revised Code. Payments shall continue pending the determination of the matter, however payment shall not be made for the period when any employee has returned to work, when an employee's treating physician has made a written statement that the employee is capable of returning to the employee's former position of employment, when work within the physical capabilities of the employee is made available by the employer or another employer, or when the employee has reached the maximum medical improvement. Where the employee is capable of work activity, but the employee's employer is unable to offer the employee any employment, the employee shall register with the director of job and family services, who shall assist the employee in finding suitable employment. The termination of temporary total disability, whether by order or otherwise, does not preclude the commencement of temporary total disability at another point in time if the employee again becomes temporarily totally disabled.
After two hundred weeks of temporary total disability benefits, the medical section of the bureau of workers' compensation shall schedule the claimant for an examination for an evaluation to determine whether or not the temporary disability has become permanent. A self-insuring employer shall notify the bureau immediately after payment of two hundred weeks of temporary total disability and request that the bureau schedule the claimant for such an examination.
When the employee is awarded compensation for temporary total disability for a period for which the employee has received benefits under Chapter 4141. of the Revised Code, the bureau shall pay an amount equal to the amount received from the award to the director of job and family services and the director shall credit the amount to the accounts of the employers to whose accounts the payment of benefits was charged or is chargeable to the extent it was charged or is chargeable.
If any compensation under this section has been paid for the same period or periods for which temporary nonoccupational accident and sickness insurance is or has been paid pursuant to an insurance policy or program to which the employer has made the entire contribution or payment for providing insurance or under a nonoccupational accident and sickness program fully funded by the employer, except as otherwise provided in this division compensation paid under this section for the period or periods shall be paid only to the extent by which the payment or payments exceeds the amount of the nonoccupational insurance or program paid or payable. Offset of the compensation shall be made only upon the prior order of the bureau or industrial commission or agreement of the claimant. If an employer provides supplemental sick leave benefits in addition to temporary total disability compensation paid under this section, and if the employer and an employee agree in writing to the payment of the supplemental sick leave benefits, temporary total disability benefits may be paid without an offset for those supplemental sick leave benefits.
As used in this division, "net take-home weekly wage" means the amount obtained by dividing an employee's total remuneration, as defined in section 4141.01 of the Revised Code, paid to or earned by the employee during the first four of the last five completed calendar quarters which immediately precede the first day of the employee's entitlement to benefits under this division, by the number of weeks during which the employee was paid or earned remuneration during those four quarters, less the amount of local, state, and federal income taxes deducted for each such week.
(B)
(1) If an employee in a claim allowed under this chapter suffers a wage loss as a result of returning to employment other than the employee's former position of employment due to an injury or occupational disease, the employee shall receive compensation at sixty-six and two-thirds per cent of the difference between the employee's average weekly wage and the employee's present earnings not to exceed the statewide average weekly wage. The payments may continue for up to a maximum of two hundred weeks, but the payments shall be reduced by the corresponding number of weeks in which the employee receives payments pursuant to division (A)(2) of section 4121.67 of the Revised Code.
(2) If an employee in a claim allowed under this chapter suffers a wage loss as a result of being unable to find employment consistent with the employee's disability resulting from the employee's injury or occupational disease, the employee shall receive compensation at sixty-six and two-thirds per cent of the difference between the employee's average weekly wage and the employee's present earnings, not to exceed the statewide average weekly wage. The payments may continue for up to a maximum of fifty-two weeks. The first twenty-six weeks of payments under division (B)(2) of this section shall be in addition to the maximum of two hundred weeks of payments allowed under division (B)(1) of this section. If an employee in a claim allowed under this chapter receives compensation under division (B)(2) of this section in excess of twenty-six weeks, the number of weeks of compensation allowable under division (B)(1) of this section shall be reduced by the corresponding number of weeks in excess of twenty-six, and up to fifty-two, that is allowable under division (B)(1) of this section.
(3) The number of weeks of wage loss payable to an employee under divisions (B)(1) and (2) of this section shall not exceed two hundred and twenty-six weeks in the aggregate.
(C) In the event an employee of a professional sports franchise domiciled in this state is disabled as the result of an injury or occupational disease, the total amount of payments made under a contract of hire or collective bargaining agreement to the employee during a period of disability is deemed an advanced payment of compensation payable under sections 4123.56 to 4123.58 of the Revised Code. The employer shall be reimbursed the total amount of the advanced payments out of any award of compensation made pursuant to sections 4123.56 to 4123.58 of the Revised Code.
(D) If an employee receives temporary total disability benefits pursuant to division (A) of this section and social security retirement benefits pursuant to the "Social Security Act," the weekly benefit amount under division (A) of this section shall not exceed sixty-six and two-thirds per cent of the statewide average weekly wage as defined in division (C) of section 4123.62 of the Revised Code.

--->ohio--->Ohio Statutes--->Chapter 4123: Workers' Compensation--->4123.57 Partial disability compensation.
===================================================================



 

4123.57 Partial disability compensation.
Partial disability compensation shall be paid as follows.
Except as provided in this section, not earlier than twenty-six weeks after the date of termination of the latest period of payments under section 4123.56 of the Revised Code, or not earlier than twenty-six weeks after the date of the injury or contraction of an occupational disease in the absence of payments under section 4123.56 of the Revised Code, the employee may file an application with the bureau of workers' compensation for the determination of the percentage of the employee's permanent partial disability resulting from an injury or occupational disease.
Whenever the application is filed, the bureau shall send a copy of the application to the employee's employer or the employer's representative and shall schedule the employee for a medical examination by the bureau medical section. The bureau shall send a copy of the report of the medical examination to the employee, the employer, and their representatives. Thereafter, the administrator of workers' compensation shall review the employee's claim file and make a tentative order as the evidence before the administrator at the time of the making of the order warrants. If the administrator determines that there is a conflict of evidence, the administrator shall send the application, along with the claimant's file, to the district hearing officer who shall set the application for a hearing.
The administrator shall notify the employee, the employer, and their representatives, in writing, of the tentative order and of the parties' right to request a hearing. Unless the employee, the employer, or their representative notifies the administrator, in writing, of an objection to the tentative order within twenty days after receipt of the notice thereof, the tentative order shall go into effect and the employee shall receive the compensation provided in the order. In no event shall there be a reconsideration of a tentative order issued under this division.
If the employee, the employer, or their representatives timely notify the administrator of an objection to the tentative order, the matter shall be referred to a district hearing officer who shall set the application for hearing with written notices to all interested persons. Upon referral to a district hearing officer, the employer may obtain a medical examination of the employee, pursuant to rules of the industrial commission.
(A) The district hearing officer, upon the application, shall determine the percentage of the employee's permanent disability, except as is subject to division (B) of this section, based upon that condition of the employee resulting from the injury or occupational disease and causing permanent impairment evidenced by medical or clinical findings reasonably demonstrable. The employee shall receive sixty-six and two-thirds per cent of the employee's average weekly wage, but not more than a maximum of thirty-three and one-third per cent of the statewide average weekly wage as defined in division (C) of section 4123.62 of the Revised Code, per week regardless of the average weekly wage, for the number of weeks which equals the percentage of two hundred weeks. Except on application for reconsideration, review, or modification, which is filed within ten days after the date of receipt of the decision of the district hearing officer, in no instance shall the former award be modified unless it is found from medical or clinical findings that the condition of the claimant resulting from the injury has so progressed as to have increased the percentage of permanent partial disability. A staff hearing officer shall hear an application for reconsideration filed and the staff hearing officer's decision is final. An employee may file an application for a subsequent determination of the percentage of the employee's permanent disability. If such an application is filed, the bureau shall send a copy of the application to the employer or the employer's representative. No sooner than sixty days from the date of the mailing of the application to the employer or the employer's representative, the administrator shall review the application. The administrator may require a medical examination or medical review of the employee. The administrator shall issue a tentative order based upon the evidence before the administrator, provided that if the administrator requires a medical examination or medical review, the administrator shall not issue the tentative order until the completion of the examination or review.
The employer may obtain a medical examination of the employee and may submit medical evidence at any stage of the process up to a hearing before the district hearing officer, pursuant to rules of the commission. The administrator shall notify the employee, the employer, and their representatives, in writing, of the nature and amount of any tentative order issued on an application requesting a subsequent determination of the percentage of an employee's permanent disability. An employee, employer, or their representatives may object to the tentative order within twenty days after the receipt of the notice thereof. If no timely objection is made, the tentative order shall go into effect. In no event shall there be a reconsideration of a tentative order issued under this division. If an objection is timely made, the application for a subsequent determination shall be referred to a district hearing officer who shall set the application for a hearing with written notice to all interested persons. No application for subsequent percentage determinations on the same claim for injury or occupational disease shall be accepted for review by the district hearing officer unless supported by substantial evidence of new and changed circumstances developing since the time of the hearing on the original or last determination.
No award shall be made under this division based upon a percentage of disability which, when taken with all other percentages of permanent disability, exceeds one hundred per cent. If the percentage of the permanent disability of the employee equals or exceeds ninety per cent, compensation for permanent partial disability shall be paid for two hundred weeks.
Compensation payable under this division accrues and is payable to the employee from the date of last payment of compensation, or, in cases where no previous compensation has been paid, from the date of the injury or the date of the diagnosis of the occupational disease.
When an award under this division has been made prior to the death of an employee, all unpaid installments accrued or to accrue under the provisions of the award are payable to the surviving spouse, or if there is no surviving spouse, to the dependent children of the employee, and if there are no children surviving, then to other dependents as the administrator determines.
(B) For purposes of this division, "payable per week" means the seven-consecutive-day period in which compensation is paid in installments according to the schedule associated with the applicable injury as set forth in this division.
Compensation paid in weekly installments according to the schedule described in this division may only be commuted to one or more lump sum payments pursuant to the procedure set forth in section 4123.64 of the Revised Code.
In cases included in the following schedule the compensation payable per week to the employee is the statewide average weekly wage as defined in division (C) of section 4123.62 of the Revised Code per week and shall be paid in installments according to the following schedule:
For the loss of a first finger, commonly known as a thumb, sixty weeks.
For the loss of a second finger, commonly called index finger, thirty-five weeks.
For the loss of a third finger, thirty weeks.
For the loss of a fourth finger, twenty weeks.
For the loss of a fifth finger, commonly known as the little finger, fifteen weeks.
The loss of a second, or distal, phalange of the thumb is considered equal to the loss of one half of such thumb; the loss of more than one half of such thumb is considered equal to the loss of the whole thumb.
The loss of the third, or distal, phalange of any finger is considered equal to the loss of one-third of the finger.
The loss of the middle, or second, phalange of any finger is considered equal to the loss of two-thirds of the finger.
The loss of more than the middle and distal phalanges of any finger is considered equal to the loss of the whole finger. In no case shall the amount received for more than one finger exceed the amount provided in this schedule for the loss of a hand.
For the loss of the metacarpal bone (bones of the palm) for the corresponding thumb, or fingers, add ten weeks to the number of weeks under this division.
For ankylosis (total stiffness of) or contractures (due to scars or injuries) which makes any of the fingers, thumbs, or parts of either useless, the same number of weeks apply to the members or parts thereof as given for the loss thereof.
If the claimant has suffered the loss of two or more fingers by amputation or ankylosis and the nature of the claimant's employment in the course of which the claimant was working at the time of the injury or occupational disease is such that the handicap or disability resulting from the loss of fingers, or loss of use of fingers, exceeds the normal handicap or disability resulting from the loss of fingers, or loss of use of fingers, the administrator may take that fact into consideration and increase the award of compensation accordingly, but the award made shall not exceed the amount of compensation for loss of a hand.
For the loss of a hand, one hundred seventy-five weeks.
For the loss of an arm, two hundred twenty-five weeks.
For the loss of a great toe, thirty weeks.
For the loss of one of the toes other than the great toe, ten weeks.
The loss of more than two-thirds of any toe is considered equal to the loss of the whole toe.
The loss of less than two-thirds of any toe is considered no loss, except as to the great toe; the loss of the great toe up to the interphalangeal joint is co-equal to the loss of one-half of the great toe; the loss of the great toe beyond the interphalangeal joint is considered equal to the loss of the whole great toe.
For the loss of a foot, one hundred fifty weeks.
For the loss of a leg, two hundred weeks.
For the loss of the sight of an eye, one hundred twenty-five weeks.
For the permanent partial loss of sight of an eye, the portion of one hundred twenty-five weeks as the administrator in each case determines, based upon the percentage of vision actually lost as a result of the injury or occupational disease, but, in no case shall an award of compensation be made for less than twenty-five per cent loss of uncorrected vision. "Loss of uncorrected vision" means the percentage of vision actually lost as the result of the injury or occupational disease.
For the permanent and total loss of hearing of one ear, twenty-five weeks; but in no case shall an award of compensation be made for less than permanent and total loss of hearing of one ear.
For the permanent and total loss of hearing, one hundred twenty-five weeks; but, except pursuant to the next preceding paragraph, in no case shall an award of compensation be made for less than permanent and total loss of hearing.
In case an injury or occupational disease results in serious facial or head disfigurement which either impairs or may in the future impair the opportunities to secure or retain employment, the administrator shall make an award of compensation as it deems proper and equitable, in view of the nature of the disfigurement, and not to exceed the sum of ten thousand dollars. For the purpose of making the award, it is not material whether the employee is gainfully employed in any occupation or trade at the time of the administrator's determination.
When an award under this division has been made prior to the death of an employee all unpaid installments accrued or to accrue under the provisions of the award shall be payable to the surviving spouse, or if there is no surviving spouse, to the dependent children of the employee and if there are no such children, then to such dependents as the administrator determines.
When an employee has sustained the loss of a member by severance, but no award has been made on account thereof prior to the employee's death, the administrator shall make an award in accordance with this division for the loss which shall be payable to the surviving spouse, or if there is no surviving spouse, to the dependent children of the employee and if there are no such children, then to such dependents as the administrator determines.
(C) Compensation for partial impairment under divisions (A) and (B) of this section is in addition to the compensation paid the employee pursuant to section 4123.56 of the Revised Code. A claimant may receive compensation under divisions (A) and (B) of this section.
In all cases arising under division (B) of this section, if it is determined by any one of the following:
(1) the amputee clinic at University hospital, Ohio state university;
(2) the opportunities for Ohioans with disabilities agency;
(3) an amputee clinic or prescribing physician approved by the administrator or the administrator's designee, that an injured or disabled employee is in need of an artificial appliance, or in need of a repair thereof, regardless of whether the appliance or its repair will be serviceable in the vocational rehabilitation of the injured employee, and regardless of whether the employee has returned to or can ever again return to any gainful employment, the bureau shall pay the cost of the artificial appliance or its repair out of the surplus created by division (B) of section 4123.34 of the Revised Code.
In those cases where an opportunities for Ohioans with disabilities agency's recommendation that an injured or disabled employee is in need of an artificial appliance would conflict with their state plan, adopted pursuant to the "Rehabilitation Act of 1973," 87 Stat. 355, 29 U.S.C.A. 701, the administrator or the administrator's designee or the bureau may obtain a recommendation from an amputee clinic or prescribing physician that they determine appropriate.
(D) If an employee of a state fund employer makes application for a finding and the administrator finds that the employee has contracted silicosis as defined in division (Y), or coal miners' pneumoconiosis as defined in division (Z), or asbestosis as defined in division (BB) of section 4123.68 of the Revised Code, and that a change of such employee's occupation is medically advisable in order to decrease substantially further exposure to silica dust, asbestos, or coal dust and if the employee, after the finding, has changed or shall change the employee's occupation to an occupation in which the exposure to silica dust, asbestos, or coal dust is substantially decreased, the administrator shall allow to the employee an amount equal to fifty per cent of the statewide average weekly wage per week for a period of thirty weeks, commencing as of the date of the discontinuance or change, and for a period of one hundred weeks immediately following the expiration of the period of thirty weeks, the employee shall receive sixty-six and two-thirds per cent of the loss of wages resulting directly and solely from the change of occupation but not to exceed a maximum of an amount equal to fifty per cent of the statewide average weekly wage per week. No such employee is entitled to receive more than one allowance on account of discontinuance of employment or change of occupation and benefits shall cease for any period during which the employee is employed in an occupation in which the exposure to silica dust, asbestos, or coal dust is not substantially less than the exposure in the occupation in which the employee was formerly employed or for any period during which the employee may be entitled to receive compensation or benefits under section 4123.68 of the Revised Code on account of disability from silicosis, asbestosis, or coal miners' pneumoconiosis. An award for change of occupation for a coal miner who has contracted coal miners' pneumoconiosis may be granted under this division even though the coal miner continues employment with the same employer, so long as the coal miner's employment subsequent to the change is such that the coal miner's exposure to coal dust is substantially decreased and a change of occupation is certified by the claimant as permanent. The administrator may accord to the employee medical and other benefits in accordance with section 4123.66 of the Revised Code.
(E) If a firefighter or police officer makes application for a finding and the administrator finds that the firefighter or police officer has contracted a cardiovascular and pulmonary disease as defined in division (W) of section 4123.68 of the Revised Code, and that a change of the firefighter's or police officer's occupation is medically advisable in order to decrease substantially further exposure to smoke, toxic gases, chemical fumes, and other toxic vapors, and if the firefighter, or police officer, after the finding, has changed or changes occupation to an occupation in which the exposure to smoke, toxic gases, chemical fumes, and other toxic vapors is substantially decreased, the administrator shall allow to the firefighter or police officer an amount equal to fifty per cent of the statewide average weekly wage per week for a period of thirty weeks, commencing as of the date of the discontinuance or change, and for a period of seventy-five weeks immediately following the expiration of the period of thirty weeks the administrator shall allow the firefighter or police officer sixty-six and two-thirds per cent of the loss of wages resulting directly and solely from the change of occupation but not to exceed a maximum of an amount equal to fifty per cent of the statewide average weekly wage per week. No such firefighter or police officer is entitled to receive more than one allowance on account of discontinuance of employment or change of occupation and benefits shall cease for any period during which the firefighter or police officer is employed in an occupation in which the exposure to smoke, toxic gases, chemical fumes, and other toxic vapors is not substantially less than the exposure in the occupation in which the firefighter or police officer was formerly employed or for any period during which the firefighter or police officer may be entitled to receive compensation or benefits under section 4123.68 of the Revised Code on account of disability from a cardiovascular and pulmonary disease. The administrator may accord to the firefighter or police officer medical and other benefits in accordance with section 4123.66 of the Revised Code.
(F) An order issued under this section is appealable pursuant to section 4123.511 of the Revised Code but is not appealable to court under section 4123.512 of the Revised Code.

===================================================================



 

4123.58 Compensation for permanent total disability.
(A) In cases of permanent total disability, the employee shall receive an award to continue until the employee's death in the amount of sixty-six and two-thirds per cent of the employee's average weekly wage, but, except as otherwise provided in division (B) of this section, not more than a maximum amount of weekly compensation which is equal to sixty-six and two-thirds per cent of the statewide average weekly wage as defined in division (C) of section 4123.62 of the Revised Code in effect on the date of injury or on the date the disability due to the occupational disease begins, nor not less than a minimum amount of weekly compensation which is equal to fifty per cent of the statewide average weekly wage as defined in division (C) of section 4123.62 of the Revised Code in effect on the date of injury or on the date the disability due to the occupational disease begins, unless the employee's average weekly wage is less than fifty per cent of the statewide average weekly wage at the time of the injury, in which event the employee shall receive compensation in an amount equal to the employee's average weekly wage.
(B) In the event the weekly workers' compensation amount when combined with disability benefits received pursuant to the Social Security Act is less than the statewide average weekly wage as defined in division (C) of section 4123.62 of the Revised Code, then the maximum amount of weekly compensation shall be the statewide average weekly wage as defined in division (C) of section 4123.62 of the Revised Code.

(C) Permanent total disability shall be compensated according to this section only when at least one of the following applies to the claimant:
(1) The claimant has lost, or lost the use of both hands or both arms, or both feet or both legs, or both eyes, or of any two thereof; however, the loss or loss of use of one limb does not constitute the loss or loss of use of two body parts;
(2) The impairment resulting from the employee's injury or occupational disease prevents the employee from engaging in sustained remunerative employment utilizing the employment skills that the employee has or may reasonably be expected to develop.
(D) Permanent total disability shall not be compensated when the reason the employee is unable to engage in sustained remunerative employment is due to any of the following reasons, whether individually or in combination:

(F) If an employee is awarded compensation for permanent total disability under this section because the employee sustained a traumatic brain injury, the employee is entitled to that compensation regardless of the employee's employment in a sheltered workshop subsequent to the award, on the condition that the employee does not receive income, compensation, or remuneration from that employment in excess of two thousand dollars in any calendar quarter. As used in this division, "sheltered workshop" means a state agency or nonprofit organization established to carry out a program of rehabilitation for handicapped individuals or to provide these individuals with remunerative employment or other occupational rehabilitating activity.

--->ohio--->Ohio Statutes--->Chapter 4123: Workers' Compensation--->4123.59 Benefits in case of death - dependency.
===================================================================



 

4123.59 Benefits in case of death - dependency.
In case an injury to or an occupational disease contracted by an employee causes the employee's death, benefits shall be in the amount and to the persons following:
(A) If there are no dependents, the disbursements from the state insurance fund is limited to the expenses provided for in section 4123.66 of the Revised Code.
(B) If there are wholly dependent persons at the time of the death, the weekly payment is sixty-six and two-thirds per cent of the average weekly wage, but not to exceed a maximum aggregate amount of weekly compensation which is equal to sixty-six and two-thirds per cent of the statewide average weekly wage as defined in division (C) of section 4123.62 of the Revised Code, and not in any event less than a minimum amount of weekly compensation which is equal to fifty per cent of the statewide average weekly wage as defined in division (C) of section 4123.62 of the Revised Code, regardless of the average weekly wage; provided however, that if the death is due to injury received or occupational disease first diagnosed after January 1, 1976, the weekly payment is sixty-six and two-thirds per cent of the average weekly wage but not to exceed a maximum aggregate amount of weekly compensation which is equal to the statewide average weekly wage as defined in division (C) of section 4123.62 of the Revised Code; provided that when any claimant is receiving total disability compensation at the time of death the wholly dependent person is eligible for the maximum compensation provided for in this section. Where there is more than one person who is wholly dependent at the time of the death of the employee, the administrator of workers' compensation shall promptly apportion the weekly amount of compensation payable under this section among the dependent persons as provided in division (D) of this section.
(1) The payment as provided in this section shall continue from the date of death of an injured or disabled employee until the death or remarriage of such dependent spouse. If the dependent spouse remarries, an amount equal to two years of compensation benefits at the weekly amount determined to be applicable to and being paid to the dependent spouse shall be paid in a lump sum to such spouse and no further compensation shall be paid to such spouse.
(2) That portion of the payment provided in division (B) of this section applicable to wholly dependent persons other than a spouse shall continue from the date of death of an injured or disabled employee to a dependent as of the date of death, other than a spouse, at the weekly amount determined to be applicable and being paid to such dependent other than a spouse, until the dependent:
(a) Reaches eighteen years of age;
(b) If pursuing a full time educational program while enrolled in an accredited educational institution and program, reaches twenty-five years of age;
(c) If mentally or physically incapacitated from having any earnings, is no longer so incapacitated.
(3)
(a) Payments under division (B) of this section to a dependent described in division (B)(2)(c) of this section shall not be terminated due to the dependent's employment in a sheltered workshop if the dependent does not receive income, compensation, or remuneration from that employment in excess of two thousand dollars in any calendar quarter.
(b) As used in division (B)(3) of this section, "sheltered workshop" has the same meaning as in section 4123.58 of the Revised Code.
(C) If there are partly dependent persons at the time of the death the weekly payment is sixty-six and two-thirds per cent of the employee's average weekly wage, not to exceed sixty-six and two-thirds per cent of the statewide average weekly wage as defined in division (C) of section 4123.62 of the Revised Code, and shall continue for such time as the administrator in each case determines.
(D) The following persons are presumed to be wholly dependent for their support upon a deceased employee:
(1) A surviving spouse who was living with the employee at the time of death or a surviving spouse who was separated from the employee at the time of death because of the aggression of the employee;
(2) A child under the age of eighteen years, or twenty-five years if pursuing a full-time educational program while enrolled in an accredited educational institution and program, or over said age if physically or mentally incapacitated from earning, upon only the one parent who is contributing more than one-half of the support for such child and with whom the child is living at the time of the death of such parent, or for whose maintenance such parent was legally liable at the time of the parent's death.
It is presumed that there is sufficient dependency to entitle a surviving natural parent or surviving natural parents, share and share alike, with whom the decedent was living at the time of the decedent's death, to a total minimum award of three thousand dollars.
The administrator may take into consideration any circumstances which, at the time of the death of the decedent, clearly indicate prospective dependency on the part of the claimant and potential support on the part of the decedent. No person shall be considered a prospective dependent unless such person is a member of the family of the deceased employee and bears to the deceased employee the relation of surviving spouse, lineal descendant, ancestor, or brother or sister. The total award for any or all prospective dependency to all such claimants, except to a natural parent or natural parents of the deceased, shall not exceed three thousand dollars to be apportioned among them as the administrator orders.
In all other cases, the question of dependency, in whole or in part, shall be determined in accordance with the facts in each particular case existing at the time of the injury resulting in the death of such employee, but no person shall be considered as dependent unless such person is a member of the family of the deceased employee, or bears to the deceased employee the relation of surviving spouse, lineal descendant, ancestor, or brother or sister.
(E) An order issued by the administrator under this section is appealable pursuant to sections 4123.511 to 4123.512 of the Revised Code.

The administrator of workers' compensation may furnish quarterly, to the tax commissioner, in a format approved by the tax commissioner, a list containing the name and social security number of any person receiving spousal death benefits. Upon receipt of this list, the commissioner shall return to the administrator, in a format designed by the commissioner, information identifying any person listed by the administrator who, as reported on the most recent return filed by the person under section 5747.08 of the Revised Code, filed under the status "married filing joint return," or "married filing separately."

4123.60 Persons eligible for death benefits - limitations.
Benefits in case of death shall be paid to such one or more of the dependents of the decedent, for the benefit of all the dependents as the administrator of workers' compensation determines. The administrator may apportion the benefits among the dependents in such manner as he deems just and equitable. Payment to a dependent subsequent in right may be made, if the administrator deems it proper, and operates to discharge all other claims therefor. The dependents or person to whom benefits are paid shall apply the same to the use of the several beneficiaries thereof according to their respective claims upon the decedent for support, in compliance with the finding and direction of the administrator.
In all cases of death where the dependents are a surviving spouse and one or more children, it is sufficient for the surviving spouse to apply to the administrator on behalf of the spouse and minor children. In cases where all the dependents are minors, a guardian or next friend of such minor dependents shall apply.
In all cases where an award had been made on account of temporary, or permanent partial, or total disability, in which there remains an unpaid balance, representing payments accrued and due to the decedent at the time of his death, the administrator may, after satisfactory proof has been made warranting such action, award or pay any unpaid balance of such award to such of the dependents of the decedent, or for services rendered on account of the last illness or death of such decedent, as the administrator determines in accordance with the circumstances in each such case. If the decedent would have been lawfully entitled to have applied for an award at the time of his death the administrator may, after satisfactory proof to warrant an award and payment, award and pay an amount, not exceeding the compensation which the decedent might have received, but for his death, for the period prior to the date of his death, to such of the dependents of the decedent, or for services rendered on account of the last illness or death of such decedent, as the administrator determines in accordance with the circumstances in each such case, but such payments may be made only in cases in which application for compensation was made in the manner required by this chapter, during the lifetime of such injured or disabled person, or within one year after the death of such injured or disabled person.
An order issued by the administrator under this section is appealable pursuant to section 4123.511 of the Revised Code but is not appealable to court under section 4123.512 of the Revised Code.

===================================================================



 

4123.61 Basis for computation of benefits.
The average weekly wage of an injured employee at the time of the injury or at the time disability due to the occupational disease begins is the basis upon which to compute benefits.
In cases of temporary total disability the compensation for the first twelve weeks for which compensation is payable shall be based on the full weekly wage of the claimant at the time of the injury or at the time of the disability due to occupational disease begins; when a factory, mine, or other place of employment is working short time in order to divide work among the employees, the bureau of workers' compensation shall take that fact into consideration when determining the wage for the first twelve weeks of temporary total disability.
Compensation for all further temporary total disability shall be based as provided for permanent disability claims.
In death, permanent total disability claims, permanent partial disability claims, and impairment of earnings claims, the claimant's or the decedent's average weekly wage for the year preceding the injury or the date the disability due to the occupational disease begins is the weekly wage upon which compensation shall be based. In ascertaining the average weekly wage for the year previous to the injury, or the date the disability due to the occupational disease begins any period of unemployment due to sickness, industrial depression, strike, lockout, or other cause beyond the employee's control shall be eliminated.
In cases where there are special circumstances under which the average weekly wage cannot justly be determined by applying this section, the administrator of workers' compensation, in determining the average weekly wage in such cases, shall use such method as will enable the administrator to do substantial justice to the claimants, provided that the administrator shall not recalculate the claimant's average weekly wage for awards for permanent total disability solely for the reason that the claimant continued working and the claimant's wages increased following the injury.

===================================================================



 

4123.62 Consideration of expected wage increases.
(A) If it is established that an injured or disabled employee was of such age and experience when injured or disabled as that under natural conditions an injured or disabled employee's wages would be expected to increase, the administrator of workers' compensation may consider that fact in arriving at an injured or disabled employee's average weekly wage.
(B) On each first day of January, the current maximum monthly benefit amounts provided in sections 4123.412, 4123.413, and 4123.414 of the Revised Code in injury cases shall be adjusted based on the United States department of labor's national consumer price index. The percentage increase in the cost of living using the index figure for the first day of September of the preceding year and the first day of September of the year preceding that year shall be applied to the maximums in effect on the preceding thirty-first day of December to obtain the increase in the cost of living during that year.
In determining the increase in the maximum benefits for any year after 1972, the base shall be the national consumer price index on the first day of September of the preceding year. The increase in the index for the applicable twelve-month period shall be determined and shall be divided by the base used. The resulting percentage shall be applied to the existing maximums to arrive at the new maximums.
(C) Effective January 1, 1974, and each first day of January thereafter, the current maximum weekly benefit amounts provided in sections 4123.56, 4123.58, and 4123.59, and division (B) of section 4123.57 of the Revised Code shall be adjusted based on the increase or decrease in the statewide average weekly wage.
"Statewide average weekly wage" means the average weekly earnings of all workers in Ohio employment subject to Chapter 4141. of the Revised Code as determined as of the first day of September for the four full calendar quarters preceding the first day of July of each year, by the director of job and family services.
The statewide average weekly wage to be used for the determination of compensation for any employee who sustains an injury, or death, or who contracts an occupational disease during the subsequent calendar year beginning with the first day of January, shall be the statewide average weekly wage so determined as of the prior first day of September adjusted to the next higher even multiple of one dollar.
Any change in benefit amounts is effective with respect to injuries sustained, occupational diseases contracted, and deaths occurring during the calendar year for which adjustment is made.
In determining the change in the maximum benefits for any year after 1978, the base shall be the statewide average weekly wage on the first day of September of the preceding year.

4123.63 Service-connected injury.
If a person in active service in the armed forces of the United States at any time during a period of war as defined in the "Veterans' Pension and Readjustment Assistance Act of 1967," 81 Stat. 181, 38 U.S.C. 101 or the period beginning May 1, 1940, and ending December 7, 1941, sustained an injury or suffered a disease while in such service, and if the person is thereafter injured or suffers an occupational disease in the course of and arising out of his employment in this state, and the industrial commission or the bureau of workers' compensation awards compensation therefor, it shall determine what part, if any, of the compensation is attributable to the injury or disease which the person sustained or suffered while in the service and what part of the compensation is attributable to the injury or occupational disease sustained or suffered in the course of and arising out of his employment in this state. That part of the compensation attributable to the injury or disease sustained or suffered while in the service shall be paid out of the statutory surplus of the state insurance fund created under section 4123.34 of the Revised Code, and shall not be merit rated or otherwise treated as part of the accident or occupational disease experience of the employer of the employee. That part of the compensation attributable to the injury or occupational disease sustained or suffered in the course of and arising out of his employment in this state shall be merit rated and treated as part of the accident or occupational disease experience of the employer of the employee, and shall be paid out of the state insurance fund, unless the employer is a self-insuring employer as provided for in section 4123.35 of the Revised Code, in which case payment shall be made by the self-insuring employer. In such case the administrator of workers' compensation may order the employer to pay the employee the full amount of compensation awarded the employee by the commission or the bureau, and in such event it shall order the employer reimbursed out of the statutory surplus of the state insurance fund for that part of the compensation paid which the commission or bureau determines to be attributable to the injury or disease sustained or suffered in the service. Nothing in this section is applicable in connection with any award of compensation made by the commission or bureau to an employee of an employer who has neither contributed to the state insurance fund nor elected to pay compensation directly under section 4123.35 of the Revised Code.
The records of any agency of the United States authorized to keep or preserve the records of service of persons in active service in the armed forces of the United States at any time during a period of war as defined in the "Veterans' Pension and Readjustment Assistance Act of 1967," 81 Stat. 181, 38 U.S.C. 101 or the period beginning May 1, 1940, and ending December 7, 1941, or to determine the fact of injury or disease of the person sustained or suffered while in service, when made available to the commission and the bureau in such manner and form as it deems proper, shall be deemed by the commission and the bureau to establish prima facie the facts of the service and the fact as to whether or not the person sustained or suffered an injury or disease while in the service, and if so, the nature thereof, and the prima-facie establishment may be deemed by the commission and the bureau to be overcome only upon clear and convincing evidence to the contrary.
The administrator may accept and credit to the statutory surplus of the state insurance fund any sum of money that may at any time be contributed to or made available to the state by the United States under any act of congress, or otherwise, to which the state is, or may become, entitled by reason of any payments made to employees out of the statutory surplus in accordance with this chapter.

--->ohio--->Ohio Statutes--->Chapter 4123: Workers' Compensation--->4123.65 Application for approval of final settlement.
===================================================================



 

4123.65 Application for approval of final settlement.
(A) A state fund employer or the employee of such an employer may file an application with the administrator of workers' compensation for approval of a final settlement of a claim under this chapter. The application shall include the settlement agreement, and except as otherwise specified in this division, be signed by the claimant and employer, and clearly set forth the circumstances by reason of which the proposed settlement is deemed desirable and that the parties agree to the terms of the settlement agreement. A claimant may file an application without an employer's signature in the following situations:
(1) The employer is no longer doing business in Ohio;
(2) The claim no longer is in the employer's industrial accident or occupational disease experience as provided in division (B) of section 4123.34 of the Revised Code and the claimant no longer is employed with that employer;
(3) The employer has failed to comply with section 4123.35 of the Revised Code.
If a claimant files an application without an employer's signature, and the employer still is doing business in this state, the administrator shall send written notice of the application to the employer immediately upon receipt of the application. If the employer fails to respond to the notice within thirty days after the notice is sent, the application need not contain the employer's signature.
If a state fund employer or an employee of such an employer has not filed an application for a final settlement under this division, the administrator may file an application on behalf of the employer or the employee, provided that the administrator gives notice of the filing to the employer and the employee and to the representative of record of the employer and of the employee immediately upon the filing. An application filed by the administrator shall contain all of the information and signatures required of an employer or an employee who files an application under this division. Every self-insuring employer that enters into a final settlement agreement with an employee shall mail, within seven days of executing the agreement, a copy of the agreement to the administrator and the employee's representative. The administrator shall place the agreement into the claimant's file.
(B) Except as provided in divisions (C) and (D) of this section, a settlement agreed to under this section is binding upon all parties thereto and as to items, injuries, and occupational diseases to which the settlement applies.
(C) No settlement agreed to under division (A) of this section or agreed to by a self-insuring employer and the self-insuring employer's employee shall take effect until thirty days after the administrator approves the settlement for state fund employees and employers, or after the self-insuring employer and employee sign the final settlement agreement. During the thirty-day period, the employer, employee, or administrator, for state fund settlements, and the employer or employee, for self-insuring settlements, may withdraw consent to the settlement by an employer providing written notice to the employer's employee and the administrator or by an employee providing written notice to the employee's employer and the administrator, or by the administrator providing written notice to the state fund employer and employee. If an employee dies during the thirty-day waiting period following the approval of a settlement, the settlement can be voided by any party for good cause shown.
(D) At the time of agreement to any final settlement agreement under division (A) of this section or agreement between a self-insuring employer and the self-insuring employer's employee, the administrator, for state fund settlements, and the self-insuring employer, for self-insuring settlements, immediately shall send a copy of the agreement to the industrial commission who shall assign the matter to a staff hearing officer. The staff hearing officer shall determine, within the time limitations specified in division (C) of this section, whether the settlement agreement is or is not a gross miscarriage of justice. If the staff hearing officer determines within that time period that the settlement agreement is clearly unfair, the staff hearing officer shall issue an order disapproving the settlement agreement. If the staff hearing officer determines that the settlement agreement is not clearly unfair or fails to act within those time limits, the settlement agreement is approved.
(E) A settlement entered into under this section may pertain to one or more claims of a claimant, or one or more parts of a claim, or the compensation or benefits pertaining to either, or any combination thereof, provided that nothing in this section shall be interpreted to require a claimant to enter into a settlement agreement for every claim that has been filed with the bureau of workers' compensation by that claimant under Chapter 4121., 4123., 4127., or 4131. of the Revised Code.
(F) A settlement entered into under this section is not appealable under section 4123.511 or 4123.512 of the Revised Code.

(A) The employer of a claimant who is injured or disabled in the course of his employment may require, without the approval of the administrator or the industrial commission, that the claimant be examined by a physician of the employer's choice one time upon any issue asserted by the employee or a physician of the employee's choice or which is to be considered by the commission. Any further requests for medical examinations shall be made to the commission which shall consider and rule on the request. The employer shall pay the cost of any examinations initiated by the employer.
(B) The bureau of workers' compensation shall prepare a form for the release of medical information, records, and reports relative to the issues necessary for the administration of a claim under this chapter. The claimant promptly shall provide a current signed release of the information, records, and reports when requested by the employer. The employer promptly shall provide copies of all medical information, records, and reports to the bureau and to the claimant or his representative upon request.
(C) If, without good cause, an employee refuses to submit to any examination scheduled under this section or refuses to release or execute a release for any medical information, record, or report that is required to be released under this section and involves an issue pertinent to the condition alleged in the claim, his right to have his claim for compensation or benefits considered, if his claim is pending before the administrator, commission, or a district or staff hearing officer, or to receive any payment for compensation or benefits previously granted, is suspended during the period of refusal.
(D) No bureau or commission employee shall alter any medical report obtained from a health care provider the bureau or commission has selected or cause or request the health care provider to alter or change a report. The bureau and commission shall make any request for clarification of a health care provider's report in writing and shall provide a copy of the request to the affected parties and their representatives at the time of making the request.

4123.66 Making additional payments for medical or funeral expenses.
(A) In addition to the compensation provided for in this chapter, the administrator of workers' compensation shall disburse and pay from the state insurance fund the amounts for medical, nurse, and hospital services and medicine as the administrator deems proper and, in case death ensues from the injury or occupational disease, the administrator shall disburse and pay from the fund reasonable funeral expenses in an amount not to exceed fifty-five hundred dollars. The bureau of workers' compensation shall reimburse anyone, whether dependent, volunteer, or otherwise, who pays the funeral expenses of any employee whose death ensues from any injury or occupational disease as provided in this section. The administrator may adopt rules, with the advice and consent of the bureau of workers' compensation board of directors, with respect to furnishing medical, nurse, and hospital service and medicine to injured or disabled employees entitled thereto, and for the payment therefor. In case an injury or industrial accident that injures an employee also causes damage to the employee's eyeglasses, artificial teeth or other denture, or hearing aid, or in the event an injury or occupational disease makes it necessary or advisable to replace, repair, or adjust the same, the bureau shall disburse and pay a reasonable amount to repair or replace the same.
(B) The administrator, in the rules the administrator adopts pursuant to division (A) of this section, may adopt rules specifying the circumstances under which the bureau may make immediate payment for the first fill of prescription drugs for medical conditions identified in an application for compensation or benefits under section 4123.84 or 4123.85 of the Revised Code that occurs prior to the date the administrator issues an initial determination order under division (B) of section 4123.511 of the Revised Code. If the claim is ultimately disallowed in a final administrative or judicial order, and if the employer is a state fund employer who pays assessments into the surplus fund account created under section 4123.34 of the Revised Code, the payments for medical services made pursuant to this division for the first fill of prescription drugs shall be charged to and paid from the surplus fund account and not charged through the state insurance fund to the employer against whom the claim was filed.
(C)
(1) If an employer or a welfare plan has provided to or on behalf of an employee any benefits or compensation for an injury or occupational disease and that injury or occupational disease is determined compensable under this chapter, the employer or a welfare plan may request that the administrator reimburse the employer or welfare plan for the amount the employer or welfare plan paid to or on behalf of the employee in compensation or benefits. The administrator shall reimburse the employer or welfare plan for the compensation and benefits paid if, at the time the employer or welfare plan provides the benefits or compensation to or on behalf of employee, the injury or occupational disease had not been determined to be compensable under this chapter and if the employee was not receiving compensation or benefits under this chapter for that injury or occupational disease. The administrator shall reimburse the employer or welfare plan in the amount that the administrator would have paid to or on behalf of the employee under this chapter if the injury or occupational disease originally would have been determined compensable under this chapter. If the employer is a merit-rated employer, the administrator shall adjust the amount of premium next due from the employer according to the amount the administrator pays the employer. The administrator shall adopt rules, in accordance with Chapter 119. of the Revised Code, to implement this division.

(V) Berylliosis: Berylliosis means a disease of the lungs caused by breathing beryllium in the form of dust or fumes, producing characteristic changes in the lungs and demonstrated by x-ray examination, by biopsy or by autopsy.
This chapter does not entitle an employee or the employee's dependents to compensation, medical treatment, or payment of funeral expenses for disability or death from berylliosis unless the employee has been subjected to injurious exposure to beryllium dust or fumes in the employee's employment in this state preceding the employee's disablement and only in the event of such disability or death resulting within eight years after the last injurious exposure; provided that such eight-year limitation does not apply to disability or death from exposure occurring after January 1, 1976. In the event of death following continuous total disability commencing within eight years after the last injurious exposure, the requirement of death within eight years after the last injurious exposure does not apply.
Before awarding compensation for partial or total disability or death due to berylliosis, the administrator of workers' compensation shall refer the claim to a qualified medical specialist for examination and recommendation with regard to the diagnosis, the extent of the disability, the nature of the disability, whether permanent or temporary, the cause of death, and other medical questions connected with the claim. An employee shall submit to such examinations, including clinical and x-ray examinations, as the administrator requires. In the event that an employee refuses to submit to examinations, including clinical and x-ray examinations, after notice from the administrator, or in the event that a claimant for compensation for death due to berylliosis fails to produce necessary consents and permits, after notice from the administrator, so that such autopsy examination and tests may be performed, then all rights for compensation are forfeited. The reasonable compensation of such specialist and the expenses of examinations and tests shall be paid, if the claim is allowed, as part of the expenses of the claim, otherwise they shall be paid from the surplus fund.
(W) Cardiovascular, pulmonary, or respiratory diseases incurred by firefighters or police officers following exposure to heat, smoke, toxic gases, chemical fumes and other toxic substances: Any cardiovascular, pulmonary, or respiratory disease of a firefighter or police officer caused or induced by the cumulative effect of exposure to heat, the inhalation of smoke, toxic gases, chemical fumes and other toxic substances in the performance of the firefighter's or police officer's duty constitutes a presumption, which may be refuted by affirmative evidence, that such occurred in the course of and arising out of the firefighter's or police officer's employment. For the purpose of this section, " firefighter" means any regular member of a lawfully constituted fire department of a municipal corporation or township, whether paid or volunteer, and "police officer" means any regular member of a lawfully constituted police department of a municipal corporation, township or county, whether paid or volunteer.
This chapter does not entitle a firefighter , or police officer, or t he firefighter's or police officer's dependents to compensation, medical treatment, or payment of funeral expenses for disability or death from a cardiovascular, pulmonary, or respiratory disease, unless the firefighter or police officer has been subject to injurious exposure to heat, smoke, toxic gases, chemical fumes, and other toxic substances in t he firefighter's or police officer's employment in this state preceding the firefighter's or police officer's disablement, some portion of which has been after January 1, 1967, except as provided in division (E) of section 4123.57 of the Revised Code.
Compensation on account of cardiovascular, pulmonary, or respiratory diseases of firefighters and police officers is payable only in the event of temporary total disability, permanent total disability, or death, in accordance with section 4123.56, 4123.58, or 4123.59 of the Revised Code. Medical, hospital, and nursing expenses are payable in accordance with this chapter. Compensation, medical, hospital, and nursing expenses are payable only in the event of such disability or death resulting within eight years after the last injurious exposure; provided that such eight-year limitation does not apply to disability or death from exposure occurring after January 1, 1976. In the event of death following continuous total disability commencing within eight years after the last injurious exposure, the requirement of death within eight years after the last injurious exposure does not apply.
This chapter does not entitle a firefighter or police officer, or t he firefighter's or police officer's dependents, to compensation, medical, hospital, and nursing expenses, or payment of funeral expenses for disability or death due to a cardiovascular, pulmonary, or respiratory disease in the event of failure or omission on the part of the firefighter or police officer truthfully to state, when seeking employment, the place, duration, and nature of previous employment in answer to an inquiry made by the employer.
Before awarding compensation for disability or death under this division, the administrator shall refer the claim to a qualified medical specialist for examination and recommendation with regard to the diagnosis, the extent of disability, the cause of death, and other medical questions connected with the claim. A firefighter or police officer shall submit to such examinations, including clinical and x-ray examinations, as the administrator requires. In the event that a firefighter or police officer refuses to submit to examinations, including clinical and x-ray examinations, after notice from the administrator, or in the event that a claimant for compensation for death under this division fails to produce necessary consents and permits, after notice from the administrator, so that such autopsy examination and tests may be performed, then all rights for compensation are forfeited. The reasonable compensation of such specialists and the expenses of examination and tests shall be paid, if the claim is allowed, as part of the expenses of the claim, otherwise they shall be paid from the surplus fund.

(Z) Coal miners' pneumoconiosis: Coal miners' pneumoconiosis, commonly referred to as "black lung disease," resulting from working in the coal mine industry and due to exposure to the breathing of coal dust, and demonstrated by x-ray examination, biopsy, autopsy or other medical or clinical tests.
This chapter does not entitle an employee or the employee's dependents to compensation, medical treatment, or payment of funeral expenses for disability or death from silicosis, asbestosis, or coal miners' pneumoconiosis unless the employee has been subject to injurious exposure to silica dust (silicon dioxide), asbestos, or coal dust in the employee's employment in this state preceding t he employee's disablement, some portion of which has been after October 12, 1945, except as provided in division (E) of section 4123.57 of the Revised Code.

Medical, hospital, and nursing expenses are payable in accordance with this chapter. Compensation, medical, hospital, and nursing expenses are payable only in the event of such disability or death resulting within eight years after the last injurious exposure; provided that such eight-year limitation does not apply to disability or death occurring after January 1, 1976, and further provided that such eight-year limitation does not apply to any asbestosis cases. In the event of death following continuous total disability commencing within eight years after the last injurious exposure, the requirement of death within eight years after the last injurious exposure does not apply.
This chapter does not entitle an employee or the employee's dependents to compensation, medical, hospital and nursing expenses, or payment of funeral expenses for disability or death due to silicosis, asbestosis, or coal miners' pneumoconiosis in the event of the failure or omission on the part of the employee truthfully to state, when seeking employment, the place, duration, and nature of previous employment in answer to an inquiry made by the employer.
Before awarding compensation for disability or death due to silicosis, asbestosis, or coal miners' pneumoconiosis, the administrator shall refer the claim to a qualified medical specialist for examination and recommendation with regard to the diagnosis, the extent of disability, the cause of death, and other medical questions connected with the claim. An employee shall submit to such examinations, including clinical and x-ray examinations, as the administrator requires. In the event that an employee refuses to submit to examinations, including clinical and x-ray examinations, after notice from the administrator, or in the event that a claimant for compensation for death due to silicosis, asbestosis, or coal miners' pneumoconiosis fails to produce necessary consents and permits, after notice from the commission, so that such autopsy examination and tests may be performed, then all rights for compensation are forfeited. The reasonable compensation of such specialist and the expenses of examinations and tests shall be paid, if the claim is allowed, as a part of the expenses of the claim, otherwise they shall be paid from the surplus fund.
(AA) Radiation illness: Any industrial process involving the use of radioactive materials.
Claims for compensation and benefits due to radiation illness are payable only in the event death or disability occurred within eight years after the last injurious exposure provided that such eight-year limitation does not apply to disability or death from exposure occurring after January 1, 1976. In the event of death following continuous disability which commenced within eight years of the last injurious exposure the requirement of death within eight years after the last injurious exposure does not apply.
(BB) Asbestosis: Asbestosis means a disease caused by inhalation or ingestion of asbestos, demonstrated by x-ray examination, biopsy, autopsy, or other objective medical or clinical tests.
All conditions, restrictions, limitations, and other provisions of this section, with reference to the payment of compensation or benefits on account of silicosis or coal miners' pneumoconiosis apply to the payment of compensation or benefits on account of any other occupational disease of the respiratory tract resulting from injurious exposures to dust.
The refusal to produce the necessary consents and permits for autopsy examination and testing shall not result in forfeiture of compensation provided the administrator finds that such refusal was the result of bona fide religious convictions or teachings to which the claimant for compensation adhered prior to the death of the decedent.

4123.75 Remedy of employee against noncomplying employer.
Any employee whose employer has failed to comply with section 4123.35 of the Revised Code, who has been injured or has suffered an occupational disease in the course of his employment, which was not purposely self-inflicted, or his dependents in case death has ensued, may file his application with the industrial commission or the bureau of workers' compensation for compensation and the administrator of workers' compensation shall determine the application for compensation in like manner as in other claims and shall make an award to the claimant as he would be entitled to receive if the employer had complied with section 4123.35 of the Revised Code. Payment of the claim shall be made promptly from the statutory surplus fund. Payment shall not bar any action under section 4123.77 of the Revised Code. If a recovery is made in an action under section 4123.77 of the Revised Code any funds paid from the state insurance fund under this section shall be repaid by the claimant. The administrator shall institute proceedings to recover from the employer any moneys paid from the surplus fund and to secure the employer's payment of the award. The employer shall pay the award in the manner and amount fixed thereby or shall furnish to the bureau a bond, in an amount and with sureties as the bureau requires, to pay the employee the award in the manner and amount fixed thereby.
An order of the administrator issued under this section is appealable pursuant to sections 4123.511 and 4123.512 of the Revised Code. In the event payments are made to a claimant which should not have been made under the final decision in the appeal of the claim, the amount of the payments shall be charged to the surplus fund created under division (B) of section 4123.34 of the Revised Code. In the event recovery is made from the noncomplying employer, the sums that are recovered shall be paid into the surplus fund.
If the employer fails to pay the compensation to the person entitled thereto, or fails to furnish the bond, within a period of ten days after notification of the award, the award constitutes a liquidated claim for damages against the employer in the amount ascertained and fixed by the administrator or commission, and the administrator shall certify the same to the attorney general who shall forthwith institute a civil action against the employer in the name of the state for the collection of the award. In the action it is sufficient for the plaintiff to set forth a copy of the record of proceedings of the commission or bureau relative to the claims certified by the administrator to the attorney general and to state that there is due to plaintiff on account of the finding and award of the commission or bureau a specified sum which plaintiff claims with interest. A certified copy of the record of proceedings in the claim shall be attached to the complaint and constitutes prima-facie evidence of the truth of the facts therein contained. Further proceedings shall be as provided in the Rules of Civil Procedure. As soon as the issues are made up in any such case, it shall be placed at the head of the trial docket and shall be first in order for trial. The cause of action provided in this section and the cause of action provided by section 4123.37 of the Revised Code may be joined in one action against an employer, and the amount of any premium paid or recovered from the employer for the period not exceeding six months during which the injury or disease, or injury or disease resulting in death, occurred shall be credited against the amount of any judgment for compensation recovered pursuant to this section. The amount recovered in the action from the employer shall be paid into the surplus fund created under division (B) of section 4123.34 of the Revised Code up to the amount paid out of the surplus fund and the balance into the state insurance fund. Any employee of a self-insuring employer, in the event of the failure of his employer to pay the compensation or furnish the medical, surgical, nursing, and hospital services and attention or funeral expenses, may file his application with the commission or the bureau for the purpose of having the amount of the compensation and the medical, surgical, nursing, and hospital services and attention or funeral expenses determined; and thereupon like proceedings shall be had before the bureau and with like effect as provided in this section.
The administrator shall adopt and publish rules governing the procedure before the bureau and commission provided in this section and shall prescribe the form of notices and the manner of serving the same in all claims for compensation arising under this section. Any suit, action, proceeding, or award brought or made against any employer under this section may be compromised by the administrator, or the suit, action, or proceeding may be prosecuted to final judgment as in the administrator's discretion may best subserve the interests of the state insurance fund.
A final judgment against the employer recovered in the manner provided in this section entitles the claimant to the compensation provided in this chapter for the injury, occupational disease, or death and the compensation shall be paid from the surplus fund created by section 4123.34 of the Revised Code, and any sum recovered on account of the judgment shall be paid to the bureau and credited to the fund the administrator designates.

===================================================================



 

4123.82 Contracts indemnifying or insuring employer void.
(A) All contracts and agreements are void which undertake to indemnify or insure an employer against loss or liability for the payment of compensation to workers or their dependents for death, injury, or occupational disease occasioned in the course of the workers' employment, or which provide that the insurer shall pay the compensation, or which indemnify the employer against damages when the injury, disease, or death arises from the failure to comply with any lawful requirement for the protection of the lives, health, and safety of employees, or when the same is occasioned by the willful act of the employer or any of the employer's officers or agents, or by which it is agreed that the insurer shall pay any such damages. No license or authority to enter into any such agreements or issue any such policies of insurance shall be granted or issued by any public authority in this state. Any corporation organized or admitted under the laws of this state to transact liability insurance as defined in section 3929.01 of the Revised Code may by amendment of its articles of incorporation or by original articles of incorporation, provide therein for the authority and purpose to make insurance in states, territories, districts, and counties, other than the state of Ohio, and in the state of Ohio in respect of contracts permitted by division (B) of this section, indemnifying employers against loss or liability for payment of compensation to workers and employees and their dependents for death, injury, or occupational disease occasioned in the course of the employment and to insure and indemnify employers against loss, expense, and liability by risk of bodily injury or death by accident, disability, sickness, or disease suffered by workers and employees for which the employer may be liable or has assumed liability.
(B) Notwithstanding division (A) of this section:
(1) No contract because of that division is void which undertakes to indemnify a self-insuring employer against all or part of such employer's loss in excess of at least fifty thousand dollars from any one disaster or event arising out of the employer's liability under this chapter, but no insurance corporation shall, directly or indirectly, represent an employer in the settlement, adjudication, determination, allowance, or payment of claims. The superintendent of insurance shall enforce this prohibition by such disciplinary orders directed against the offending insurance corporation as the superintendent of insurance deems appropriate in the circumstances and the administrator of workers' compensation shall enforce this prohibition by such disciplinary orders directed against the offending employer as the administrator deems appropriate in the circumstances, which orders may include revocation of the insurance corporation's right to enter into indemnity contracts and revocation of the employer's status as a self-insuring employer.
(2) The administrator may enter into a contract of indemnity with any such employer upon such terms, payment of such premium, and for such amount and form of indemnity as the administrator determines and the bureau of workers' compensation board of directors may procure reinsurance of the liability of the public and private funds under this chapter, or any part of the liability in respect of either or both of the funds, upon such terms and premiums or other payments from the fund or funds as the administrator deems prudent in the maintenance of a solvent fund or funds from year to year. When making the finding of fact which the administrator is required by section 4123.35 of the Revised Code to make with respect to the financial ability of an employer, no contract of indemnity, or the ability of the employer to procure such a contract, shall be considered as increasing the financial ability of the employer.
(C) Nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit the administrator or an other-states' insurer from providing to employers in this state other-states' coverage or limited other-states' coverage in accordance with section 4123.292 of the Revised Code.
(D) Notwithstanding any other section of the Revised Code, but subject to division (A) of this section, the superintendent of insurance shall have the sole authority to regulate any insurance products, except for the bureau of workers' compensation and those products offered by the bureau, that indemnify or insure employers against workers' compensation losses in this state or that are sold to employers in this state.

4123.84 Claims for injury or death barred after two years - exceptions.
(A) In all cases of injury or death, claims for compensation or benefits for the specific part or parts of the body injured shall be forever barred unless, within two years after the injury or death:
(1) Written or facsimile notice of the specific part or parts of the body claimed to have been injured has been made to the industrial commission or the bureau of workers' compensation;

(3) In the event the employer is a self-insuring employer, one of the following has occurred:
(a) Written or facsimile notice of the specific part or parts of the body claimed to have been injured has been given to the commission or bureau or the employer has furnished treatment by a licensed physician in the employ of an employer, provided, however, that the furnishing of such treatment shall not constitute a recognition of a claim as compensable, but shall do no more than satisfy the requirements of this section;
(b) Compensation or benefits have been paid or furnished equal to or greater than is provided for in sections 4123.52, 4123.55 to 4123.62, and 4123.64 to 4123.67 of the Revised Code.
(4) Written or facsimile notice of death has been given to the commission or bureau.

(C) The commission has continuing jurisdiction as set forth in section 4123.52 of the Revised Code over a claim which meets the requirement of this section, including jurisdiction to award compensation or benefits for loss or impairment of bodily functions developing in a part or parts of the body not specified pursuant to division (A)(1) of this section, if the commission finds that the loss or impairment of bodily functions was due to and a result of or a residual of the injury to one of the parts of the body set forth in the written notice filed pursuant to division (A)(1) of this section.
(D) Any claim pending before the administrator, the commission, or a court on December 11, 1967, in which the remedy is affected by this section is governed by this section.
(E) Notwithstanding the requirement that the notice required to be given to the bureau, commission, or employer under this section is to be in writing or facsimile, the bureau may accept, assign a claim number, and process a claim when notice is provided verbally over the telephone. Immediately upon receipt of notice provided verbally over the telephone, the bureau shall send a written or facsimile notice to the employer of the bureau's receipt of the verbal notice. Within fifteen days after receipt of the bureau's written or facsimile notice, the employer may in writing or facsimile either verify or not verify the verbal notice. If the bureau does not receive the written or facsimile notification from the employer or receives a written or facsimile notification verifying the verbal notice within such time period, the claim is validly filed and such verbal notice tolls the statute of limitations in regard to the claim filed and is considered to meet the requirements of written or facsimile notice required by this section.
(F) As used in division (A)(3)(b) of this section, "benefits" means payments by a self-insuring employer to, or on behalf of, an employee for a hospital bill, a medical bill to a licensed physician or hospital, or an orthopedic or prosthetic device.

--->ohio--->Ohio Statutes--->Chapter 4123: Workers' Compensation--->4123.931 Statutory subrogee subrogated to rights of claimant against third party.
===================================================================



 

4123.931 Statutory subrogee subrogated to rights of claimant against third party.
(A) The payment of compensation or benefits pursuant to this chapter or Chapter 4121., 4127., or 4131., of the Revised Code creates a right of recovery in favor of a statutory subrogee against a third party, and the statutory subrogee is subrogated to the rights of a claimant against that third party. The net amount recovered is subject to a statutory subrogee's right of recovery.
(B) If a claimant, statutory subrogee, and third party settle or attempt to settle a claimant's claim against a third party, the claimant shall receive an amount equal to the uncompensated damages divided by the sum of the subrogation interest plus the uncompensated damages, multiplied by the net amount recovered, and the statutory subrogee shall receive an amount equal to the subrogation interest divided by the sum of the subrogation interest plus the uncompensated damages, multiplied by the net amount recovered, except that the net amount recovered may instead be divided and paid on a more fair and reasonable basis that is agreed to by the claimant and statutory subrogee. If while attempting to settle, the claimant and statutory subrogee cannot agree to the allocation of the net amount recovered, the claimant and statutory subrogee may file a request with the administrator of workers' compensation for a conference to be conducted by a designee appointed by the administrator, or the claimant and statutory subrogee may agree to utilize any other binding or non-binding alternative dispute resolution process.
The claimant and statutory subrogee shall pay equal shares of the fees and expenses of utilizing an alternative dispute resolution process, unless they agree to pay those fees and expenses in another manner. The administrator shall not assess any fees to a claimant or statutory subrogee for a conference conducted by the administrator's designee.
(C) If a claimant and statutory subrogee request that a conference be conducted by the administrator's designee pursuant to division (B) of this section, both of the following apply:
(1) The administrator's designee shall schedule a conference on or before sixty days after the date that the claimant and statutory subrogee filed a request for the conference.
(2) The determination made by the administrator's designee is not subject to Chapter 119. of the Revised Code.
(D) When a claimant's action against a third party proceeds to trial and damages are awarded, both of the following apply:
(1) The claimant shall receive an amount equal to the uncompensated damages divided by the sum of the subrogation interest plus the uncompensated damages, multiplied by the net amount recovered, and the statutory subrogee shall receive an amount equal to the subrogation interest divided by the sum of the subrogation interest plus the uncompensated damages, multiplied by the net amount recovered.
(2) The court in a nonjury action shall make findings of fact, and the jury in a jury action shall return a general verdict accompanied by answers to interrogatories that specify the following:
(a) The total amount of the compensatory damages;
(b) The portion of the compensatory damages specified pursuant to division (D)(2)(a) of this section that represents economic loss;
(c) The portion of the compensatory damages specified pursuant to division (D)(2)(a) of this section that represents noneconomic loss.
(E)
(1) After a claimant and statutory subrogee know the net amount recovered, and after the means for dividing it has been determined under division (B) or (D) of this section, a claimant may establish an interest-bearing trust account for the full amount of the subrogation interest that represents estimated future payments of compensation, medical benefits, rehabilitation costs, or death benefits, reduced to present value, from which the claimant shall make reimbursement payments to the statutory subrogee for the future payments of compensation, medical benefits, rehabilitation costs, or death benefits. If the workers' compensation claim associated with the subrogation interest is settled, or if the claimant dies, or if any other circumstance occurs that would preclude any future payments of compensation, medical benefits, rehabilitation costs, and death benefits by the statutory subrogee, any amount remaining in the trust account after final reimbursement is paid to the statutory subrogee for all payments made by the statutory subrogee before the ending of future payments shall be paid to the claimant or the claimant's estate.
(2) A claimant may use interest that accrues on the trust account to pay the expenses of establishing and maintaining the trust account, and all remaining interest shall be credited to the trust account.
(3) If a claimant establishes a trust account, the statutory subrogee shall provide payment notices to the claimant on or before the thirtieth day of June and the thirty-first day of December every year listing the total amount that the statutory subrogee has paid for compensation, medical benefits, rehabilitation costs, or death benefits during the half of the year preceding the notice. The claimant shall make reimbursement payments to the statutory subrogee from the trust account on or before the thirty-first day of July every year for a notice provided by the thirtieth day of June, and on or before the thirty-first day of January every year for a notice provided by the thirty-first day of December. The claimant's reimbursement payment shall be in an amount that equals the total amount listed on the notice the claimant receives from the statutory subrogee.
(F) If a claimant does not establish a trust account as described in division (E)(1) of this section, the claimant shall pay to the statutory subrogee, on or before thirty days after receipt of funds from the third party, the full amount of the subrogation interest that represents estimated future payments of compensation, medical benefits, rehabilitation costs, or death benefits.
(G) A claimant shall notify a statutory subrogee and the attorney general of the identity of all third parties against whom the claimant has or may have a right of recovery, except that when the statutory subrogee is a self-insuring employer, the claimant need not notify the attorney general. No settlement, compromise, judgment, award, or other recovery in any action or claim by a claimant shall be final unless the claimant provides the statutory subrogee and, when required, the attorney general, with prior notice and a reasonable opportunity to assert its subrogation rights. If a statutory subrogee and, when required, the attorney general are not given that notice, or if a settlement or compromise excludes any amount paid by the statutory subrogee, the third party and the claimant shall be jointly and severally liable to pay the statutory subrogee the full amount of the subrogation interest.
(H) The right of subrogation under this chapter is automatic, regardless of whether a statutory subrogee is joined as a party in an action by a claimant against a third party. A statutory subrogee may assert its subrogation rights through correspondence with the claimant and the third party or their legal representatives. A statutory subrogee may institute and pursue legal proceedings against a third party either by itself or in conjunction with a claimant. If a statutory subrogee institutes legal proceedings against a third party, the statutory subrogee shall provide notice of that fact to the claimant. If the statutory subrogee joins the claimant as a necessary party, or if the claimant elects to participate in the proceedings as a party, the claimant may present the claimant's case first if the matter proceeds to trial. If a claimant disputes the validity or amount of an asserted subrogation interest, the claimant shall join the statutory subrogee as a necessary party to the action against the third party.
(I) The statutory subrogation right of recovery applies to, but is not limited to, all of the following:
(1) Amounts recoverable from a claimant's insurer in connection with underinsured or uninsured motorist coverage, notwithstanding any limitation contained in Chapter 3937. of the Revised Code;
(2) Amounts that a claimant would be entitled to recover from a political subdivision, notwithstanding any limitations contained in Chapter 2744. of the Revised Code;
(3) Amounts recoverable from an intentional tort action.
(J) If a claimant's claim against a third party is for wrongful death or the claim involves any minor beneficiaries, amounts allocated under this section are subject to the approval of probate court.
(K) Except as otherwise provided in this division, the administrator shall deposit any money collected under this section into the public fund or the private fund of the state insurance fund, as appropriate.

--->ohio--->Ohio Statutes--->Chapter 4125: Industrial Commission/Worker's Compensation--->4125-1-01 Wage loss compensation.
===================================================================



 

4125-1-01 Wage loss compensation.
(A) Definitions:
The following definitions shall apply to the adjudication of applications for wage loss compensation:
(1) "Adjudicator" means the administrator of the bureau of workers' compensation, a district hearing officer, a staff hearing officer, or the industrial commission. However, in the case of a wage loss application filed with a self-insuring employer, the self-insuring employer shall make the initial determination as provided in paragraph (H) of this rule.
(2) "Comparably paying work" means suitable employment in which the injured worker's weekly rate of pay is equal to or greater than the average weekly wage of the injured worker.
(3) "Employer of record" means the employer with whom the injured worker was employed at the time of the injury or on the date of disability in an occupational disease claim, or to the entity that is determined by the bureau of workers' compensation, or by industrial commission order, to succeed to the rights and responsibilities of the employer for workers' compensation claim purposes.
(4) "Employment" means work performed or to be performed pursuant to a contract of hire between an employee and an employer as those terms are defined in divisions (A) and (B) of section 4123.01 of the Revised Code. "Employment" also includes work performed or to be performed as self-employment.
(5) "Former position of employment" means the employment engaged in by the injured worker, including job duties, hours and rate of pay, at the time of the industrial injury or on the date of disability in an occupational disease claim allowed under Chapter 4123. of the Revised Code.
(6) "Injured worker," for purposes of wage loss compensation, means an employee as defined in division (A) of section 4121.01 and division (A)(1) of section 4123.01 of the Revised Code, who asserts a right, demand, or claim for benefits pursuant to division (B) of section 4123.56 of the Revised Code.
(7) "Injured worker's weekly wage loss" means his or her working wage loss or non-working wage loss during a calendar week or the injured worker's work week.
(8) "Non-working wage loss" means the dollar amount of the diminishment in wages sustained by an injured worker who has not returned to work because he or she has been unable to find suitable employment (as described in paragraph (C) of this rule.) However, the extent of the diminishment must be the direct result of physical and/or psychiatric restrictions caused by the impairment that is causally related to an industrial injury or occupational disease in a claim allowed under Chapter 4123. of the Revised Code.
(9) "Present earnings" means the injured worker's actual weekly earnings which are generated by gainful employment except as provided in paragraph (A)(9)(b) of this rule. It is a rebuttable presumption that earnings from paid leave provided by the employer will be included in present earnings.
(a) Earnings generated from commission sales, bonuses, gratuities, and all other forms of compensation for personal services customarily received by an injured worker in the course of his or her employment and accounted for by the injured worker to his or her employer will be included in present earnings for the purposes of computing the wage loss award. In instances where sales commission, bonuses, gratuities, or other compensation are not paid on a weekly or biweekly basis, their receipt will be apportioned over the number of weeks it is determined were required to initiate and consummate the sale or earn the bonus, gratuity, or other compensation.
(b) In the case of an injured worker engaged in self-employment, "present earnings" means gross income minus business-related expenses. For purposes of calculating present earnings, there shall be a rebuttable presumption that an injured worker engaged in self-employment has a gross income of at least fifty percent of the statewide average weekly wage or such other compensation that the bureau of workers' compensation shall impute to self-employed persons for purposes of determining premium payments. Income derived from self-employment shall be reported on at least a quarterly basis.
(10) "Restriction" means any physical and/or psychiatric limitation directly resulting from the allowed conditions in the claim.
(11) "Statewide average weekly wage" has the same meaning as set forth in division (C) of section 4123.62 of the Revised Code.
(12) "Suitable employment" means work which is within the injured worker's restrictions, and which may be performed by the injured worker subject to all physical, psychiatric, mental, and vocational limitations to which the injured worker was subject on the date of the injury, or on the date of disability in occupational disease claims.
(13) "Voluntary retirement" means voluntary termination of employment by an injured worker such that the injured worker is completely removed from the active work force based on factors that are not causally related to the allowed conditions in the claim.
(14) "Wages" means the amount upon which the injured worker's average weekly wage is calculated pursuant to section 4123.61 of the Revised Code.
(15) "Working wage loss" means the dollar amount of the diminishment in wages sustained by an injured worker who has returned to employment which is not his or her former position of employment. However, the extent of the diminishment must be the direct result of physical and/or psychiatric restriction(s) caused by the impairment that is causally related to an industrial injury or occupational disease in a claim allowed under Chapter 4123. of the Revised Code.
(B) Applications for wage loss compensation
Applications for wage loss compensation shall be filed on forms provided by the bureau of workers' compensation or equivalent forms. In cases involving self-insuring employers, a copy of the application shall be filed with the self-insuring employer. No payment of compensation shall be approved by the administrator, or by a self-insuring employer in a self-insured claim, unless the request is filed on the appropriate form or equivalent form that provides the required information as described in paragraph (B)(1) through (B)(4) of this rule. Upon the earlier of a determination not to pay wage loss compensation by the administrator, or by the self-insuring employer in a self-insured employer claim, or upon expiration of thirty days of the filing of the application for wage loss compensation, in the absence of payment of wage loss compensation, the application for wage loss compensation will be referred to the industrial commission.
(1) The injured worker must certify that all the information that is provided in the application is true and accurate to the best of his or her knowledge and further certify that he or she served a copy of the application, with copies of supporting documents, on the employer of record unless the employer of record is out of business.

(a) Identification of the restrictions of the injured worker;
(b) An opinion on whether the restrictions are permanent or temporary;
(c) When the restrictions are temporary, an opinion as to the expected duration of the restrictions. Temporary restrictions cannot be certified for a period to exceed ninety days without a new examination of the injured worker
(d) When the restrictions are permanent, the report must be based on an examination or treatment conducted within ninety days prior to the initial date of wage loss compensation requested on the application for wage loss compensation;
(e) The date of the last medical examination;
(f) The date of the report;
(g) The name of the physician who authored the report; and
(h) The physician's signature.
(3) Supplemental medical reports regarding the ongoing status of the medical restrictions causally related to the allowed conditions in the claim must be submitted to the bureau of workers' compensation or the self-insuring employer in self-insured claims once during every ninety day period after the filing of the initial application, if the restrictions are temporary. If the restrictions are permanent, the bureau of workers' compensation or the self-insuring employer may request a supplemental medical report once during every one hundred eighty day period subsequent to the filing of the initial application. If such a request is made, both the medical examination shall be completed and the medical report resulting from the supplemental medical examination shall be submitted to the bureau of workers' compensation, or to the self-insuring employer in self-insured claims, within ninety days of the date of the request for the supplemental medical report. The supplemental medical reports shall comply with paragraph (B)(2)(a), (b), (c), (e), (f), (g), and (h) of this rule.
Paragraph (B)(3) of this rule shall not prohibit the employer's authority to require the injured worker to be examined by a physician of the employer's choice pursuant to Section 4123.651 of the Revised Code and 4121-3-09 of the Administrative Code.
(4) The application shall contain an employment history. The employment history shall include a description of each position which was held by the injured worker.
(C) Non-Working Wage Loss Compensation
An injured worker applying for or receiving non-working wage loss compensation shall supplement his or her wage loss application with job search statements describing the search for suitable employment, in accordance with the following:
(1) Job search statements shall be submitted for every week where non-working wage loss compensation is sought;
(2) The completed job search statements shall be submitted with the wage loss application and/or any subsequent request for non-working wage loss compensation;
(3) An injured worker who receives non-working wage loss compensation for periods after the filing of the application for wage loss compensation shall submit the job search statements completed pursuant to paragraphs (C)(1), (C)(4) and (C)(5) of this rule, at a minimum, every four weeks to the bureau of worker's compensation or the self-insuring employer in self-insured claims during the period when non-working wage loss compensation is requested;
(4) Job search statements shall include the name and address of each employer contacted, the employer's telephone number, the position sought, a reasonable identification by name or position of the person contacted, the date and method of contact, for on-line job searches, a copy of the on-line posting and verification of the application submission, the result of the contact, and any other information requested by the bureau of workers' compensation job search statement; and
(5) Job search statements shall be submitted on forms provided by the bureau of workers' compensation or equivalent forms.
(D) Working Wage Loss Compensation
Except as otherwise provided in paragraphs (D)(4) and (D)(5) of this rule, an injured worker applying for or receiving working wage loss compensation shall supplement his or her wage loss application with a job search statement describing the injured worker's search for comparably paying work unless excused by the bureau of workers' compensation, the industrial commission, or the self-insuring employer in self-insured employer claims.
(1) Unless a job search has been excused by the bureau of workers' compensation, the industrial commission, or the self-insuring employer in self-insured employer claims, the job search statements shall comply with the following requirements:
(a) Job search statements shall be submitted for every week where working wage loss compensation is sought;
(b) The completed job search statements shall be submitted with any subsequent request for working wage loss compensation;
(c) An injured worker who receives working wage loss compensation for periods after the filing of the application for wage loss compensation shall submit the job search statements completed pursuant to paragraph (D)(1) of this rule, at a minimum, every four weeks to the bureau of workers' compensation or the self-insuring employer in self-insured employer claims during the period when working wage loss compensation is requested;
(d) Job search statements shall include the name and address of each employer contacted, the employer's telephone number, the position sought, a reasonable identification by name or position of the person contacted, the date and method of contact, for on-line job searches, a copy of the on-line posting and verification of the application submission, the result of the contact, and any other information required by the bureau of workers' compensation job search statement;
(2) Job search statements shall be submitted on forms provided by the bureau of workers' compensation or equivalent forms.
(3) Failure to perform a job search as required by paragraph (D) of this rule will be construed as a voluntary limitation of income in accordance with paragraph (G)(2) of this rule.
(4) When an injured worker qualifies for compensation for temporary total disability pursuant to division (A) of section 4123.56 of the Revised Code, working wage loss compensation may be payable, but no job search is required, when the injured worker returns to alternative employment with the same employer, or another employer at the direction of the employer of record, as provided in division (A) of section 4123.56 of the Revised Code and rule 4121-3-32 of the Administrative Code.
(5) Working wage loss compensation may be payable, but no job search is required, when the injured worker must miss work in order to obtain treatment for the allowed conditions that cannot be obtained outside of work hours. Under paragraph (D)(5) of this rule, an injured worker must file an application for wage loss compensation in addition to providing documentation that:
(a) the treatment was medically necessary for the injured worker to perform his or her job;
(b) the injured worker could not continue to work full time without the treatment; and
(c) the treatment was available only during the injured worker's hours of employment.
(E) Factors to consider in the adjudication of an application for wage loss compensation
The injured worker is responsible for and bears the burden of producing evidence regarding his or her entitlement to wage loss compensation. Unless the injured worker meets this burden, wage loss compensation shall be denied. A party who asserts, as a defense to the payment of wage loss compensation, that the injured worker has failed to meet his burden of producing evidence regarding his or her entitlement to wage loss compensation is not required to produce evidence to support that assertion. However, any party asserting a defense to the payment of wage loss compensation, for a reason other than the injured worker's failure to produce evidence, through motion, appeal, or otherwise is solely responsible for and bears the burden of producing evidence to support those defenses. If there is insufficient evidence to support a defense to the payment of wage loss compensation, that defense shall not be used as a grounds to deny such compensation. In no case shall this rule be construed as placing on the industrial commission any burden to produce evidence.
In considering an injured worker's eligibility for wage loss compensation the adjudicator shall give consideration to, and base the determinations on, evidence in the file, or presented at hearing, relating to:
(1) The injured worker's search for suitable employment when required under the provisions of this rule.
(a) As a prerequisite to receiving non-working wage loss compensation, and working wage loss compensation unless excused under paragraph (D) of this rule, for any period during which such compensation is requested, the injured worker shall demonstrate that he or she has:
(i) Complied with paragraph (B)(2) of this rule and, if applicable, with paragraph (B)(3) of this rule;
(ii) Sought suitable employment with the employer of record at the onset of the first period for which wage loss compensation is requested unless the injured worker establishes that it would be futile to seek suitable employment with the employer of record. (e.g. The injured worker was discharged or the employer of record is out of business.); and
(iii) In the case of non-working wage loss, the injured worker must register with the Ohio Department of Job and Family Services or, if the injured worker is an out-of-state resident, must register with the equivalent of the Ohio Department of Job and Family Services in the state of residence and begin or continue a job search if no suitable employment is available with the employer of record. Proof of registration with the applicable agency is required for both in-state and out-of-state residents to demonstrate compliance with this rule.
(b) An injured worker may first search for suitable employment which is within his or her skills, prior employment history, and educational background. If within sixty days from the commencement of the injured worker's job search, he or she is unable to find such employment, the injured worker shall expand his or her job search to include entry level and/or unskilled employment opportunities.
(c) A good faith effort to search for suitable employment that is comparably paying work is required of those seeking non-working wage loss compensation pursuant to paragraph (C) of this rule and of those seeking working-wage loss compensation pursuant to paragraph (D)of this rule, who have not returned to suitable employment that is comparably paying work, except for those injured workers who are receiving public relief and are defined as work relief employees in Chapter 4127. of the Revised Code. A good faith effort necessitates the injured worker's consistent, sincere, and best attempts to obtain suitable employment that will eliminate the wage loss. In evaluating whether the injured worker has made a good faith effort, attention will be given to the evidence regarding all relevant factors including, but not limited to:
(i) The injured worker's skills, prior employment history, and educational background. These factors may be considered a positive or negative asset to securing suitable employment;
(ii) The number, quality (e.g., in-person, internet / e-mail, telephone, U.S. mail, with resume), and regularity of contacts made by the injured worker with prospective employers, public and private employment services;
(iii) Except as provided in paragraph (E)(1)(c)(v) of this rule, for an injured worker seeking any amount of non-working wage loss compensation, the amount of time devoted to making prospective employer contacts during the period for which non-working wage loss compensation is sought as compared with the time spent working at the former position of employment or number of hours able to work due to the restrictions; while the adjudicator shall consider this comparison in reaching a determination of whether there was a good faith job search, the fact that an injured worker did not search for work for as many hours as were worked in the former position of employment shall not necessarily be dispositive;
(iv) Except as provided in paragraph (E)(1)(c)(v) of this rule, for an injured worker seeking any amount of working wage loss compensation, the amount of time devoted to making prospective employer contacts during the period for which working wage loss compensation is sought as well as the number of hours spent working; and any non-claim related limitations on the injured worker's opportunity to make prospective employer contacts because of his or her working; while the adjudicator shall consider this comparison in reaching a determination of whether there was a good faith job search, the fact that the sum of the hours the injured worker spent searching for work and working is not as many hours as were worked in the former position of employment shall not necessarily be dispositive;
(v) Where the injured worker, in the former position of employment, worked a variable number of hours per week, the adjudicator shall determine, with respect to the former position of employment, for the period of fifty-two calendar weeks preceding the injury, or in occupational disease cases, the date of disability, the minimum, maximum, and average number of hours per week the injured worker worked. If the injured worker worked less than fifty-two calendar weeks in the former position of employment, the determination shall be based on the number of weeks the injured worker actually worked. The adjudicator shall consider these determinations in relation to:
(a) The amount of time devoted to making prospective employer contacts during the period for which working wage loss is sought as well as the number of hours spent working, for an injured worker seeking any amount of working wage loss; and
(b)The amount of time devoted to making prospective employer contacts during the period for which non-working wage loss is sought as compared with the time spent working at the former position of employment, for an injured worker seeking non-working wage loss; while the adjudicator shall consider the determinations arrived at pursuant to paragraph (E)(1)(c)(v) of this rule in reaching a conclusion as to whether there was a good faith job search, the number of hours per week, in and of itself, shall not necessarily be dispositive.
(vi) Any refusal without good cause by the injured worker to accept assistance from the bureau of workers' compensation in finding employment;
(vii) Any refusal by the injured worker to accept the assistance, where such assistance is rendered free of charge to the injured worker, of any public or private entity or the assistance of the employer of record in finding employment;
(viii) Labor market conditions including, but not limited to, the numbers and types of employers located in the geographical area surrounding the injured worker's place of residence;
(ix) The injured worker's restrictions;
(x) Any recent activity on the part of the injured worker to change his or her place of residence and the impact such a change, if made, would have on the reasonable probability of success in the search for employment;
(xi) The injured worker's economic status as it impacts on his or her ability to search for employment including, but not limited to, such things as access to public and private transportation and telephone service and other means of communications;
(xii) The self-employed injured worker's documentation of efforts undertaken on a weekly basis to produce self-employment income;
(xiii) Any part-time employment engaged in by the injured worker and whether that employment constitutes a voluntary limitation on the injured worker's present earnings;
(xiv) Whether the injured worker restricts his or her search to employment that would require him or her to work fewer hours per week than he or she worked in the former position of employment. However, the injured worker shall not be required to seek employment which would require him or her to work a greater number of hours per week than he or she worked in the former position of employment; and
(xv) Whether, as a result of the restrictions arising from the allowed conditions in the claim, the injured worker is enrolled in a rehabilitation program with the opportunities for ohioans with disabilities agency whereby the injured worker attends an educational institution approved by the opportunities for ohioans with disabilities agency.
(2) The injured worker's failure to accept a good faith offer of suitable employment.
(a) Offers of employment by the employer of record will not be given consideration by the adjudicator unless they are made in writing and contain a reasonable description of the job duties, hours, and rate of pay.
(b) The adjudicator shall consider employment descriptions of any jobs offered to the injured worker by employers other than the employer of record.
(c) Although the injured worker's refusal to accept a good faith offer of suitable employment may be considered by the adjudicator as a reason for denying, reducing, or eliminating wage loss compensation, the injured worker may not be required, as a precondition to the receipt of wage loss compensation, to accept a job offer which would require the injured worker to work a greater number of hours per week than the former position of employment except as provided in paragraph (E)(2)(d) of this rule. The adjudicator may consider an employer's requirement that the injured worker work different shifts or relocate as factors in determining whether the injured worker failed to accept a good faith offer of suitable employment.
(d) Where the injured worker, in the former position of employment, worked a variable number of hours per week and the injured worker is offered a job which would require the injured worker to work a variable number of hours per week, the offer of variable hour employment shall not be considered an offer of unsuitable employment solely because the minimum or maximum number of hours per week to be worked by the injured worker in the position offered is insubstantially greater or less than the minimum or maximum number of hours per week which the injured worker worked in the former position of employment. In determining whether, pursuant to this paragraph, an offer of employment is suitable, the adjudicator shall:
(i) Determine, for the period of fifty-two calendar weeks preceding the date of the industrial injury or, in occupational disease cases, the date of disability, the maximum, minimum, and average number of hours per week which the injured worker worked in the former position of employment. If the injured worker worked less than fifty-two calendar weeks in the former position of employment, the determination shall be based on the number of weeks the injured worker actually worked; and
(ii) Compare the maximum and minimum number of hours per week which the injured worker could be required to work in the position of employment offered to the injured worker to the determinations made in paragraph (E)(2)(d)(i) of this rule to assist in determining whether the offer is one of suitable employment.
(3) Other actions of the injured worker which result in a wage loss not causally related to the allowed conditions in the claim, including, but not limited to, the voluntary retirement of the injured worker, provided that where an injured worker has secured employment which will likely extend beyond the short term and which will likely become comparably paying work and/or will likely provide other employment-related benefits, the injured worker's lack of a search for comparably paying work may not bar his or her receipt of wage loss compensation but is a factor that may be considered in a broader based analysis as to whether the injured worker has voluntarily limited his or her income.
(F) Orders issued by the Industrial Commission and its Hearing Officers
The industrial commission and its hearing officers in issuing orders granting or denying wage loss compensation shall comply with the requirements of division (B) of section 4121.36 of the Revised Code. To comply with division (B) of said section, the commission and/or hearing officer shall recite in those orders that they have considered and weighed the evidence, as required by paragraph (E) of this rule.
(1) In the event of a denial of compensation for a week or period of weeks for which an application has been made, the commission or hearing officer shall recite in the order that the injured worker has not met his or her burden of proving compliance with this rule for that week or period of weeks and shall state the evidence relied upon to support the denial of wage loss for that week or period of weeks.
(2) If the commission or hearing officer grants any amount of wage loss compensation for a week or period of weeks for which an application has been made, the commission or hearing officer must find and recite in the order that:
(a) The injured worker's present earnings are less than the injured worker's wages;
(b) The difference between the injured worker's wages and present earnings is the result of medical restrictions that are causally related to an industrial injury or an occupational disease allowed in a claim which was filed under Chapter 4123. of the Revised Code and in which wage loss is requested;
(c) The injured worker has made a good faith effort to search for suitable employment which is comparably paying work, when required by paragraphs (C) or (D) of this rule, but has not returned to suitable employment which is comparably paying work; and
(d) The injured worker has otherwise complied with the requirements of this rule.
(G) Computation of wage loss
(1) Unless otherwise provided in paragraphs (G)(2) and (I)(2) of this rule, diminishment of wages shall be calculated based on the:
(a) Injured worker's average weekly wage at the time of the injury or at the time of the disability due to occupational disease in accordance with the provisions of section 4123.61 of the Revised Code; and
(b) The injured worker's present earnings as defined in paragraph (A)(9) of this rule.
(2) Voluntary Limitations of Income
(a) The wage loss compensation to be paid an injured worker who voluntarily fails to accept a good faith offer of suitable employment shall be calculated as sixty-six and two-thirds percent of the difference between the injured worker's average weekly wage in the former position of employment and the weekly wage the injured worker would have earned in the employment he or she refused to accept.
(b) ) If the adjudicator finds that the injured worker has returned to employment but has voluntarily limited the number of hours which he or she is working, or has accepted a job which does not constitute comparably paying work, and that the injured worker is nonetheless entitled to wage loss compensation, the adjudicator, for each week of wage loss compensation requested by the injured worker, shall determine: the number of hours worked by the injured worker in the employment position to which he or she has returned, and the hourly wage earned by the injured worker in the employment position to which he or she has returned. In such a case, the adjudicator shall order wage loss compensation to be paid at a rate of sixty-six and two-thirds percent of the difference between: the injured worker's average weekly wage in the claim and the weekly wage the injured worker would have earned had the injured worker not voluntarily limited his or her hours.

===================================================================



 

Ohio Constitution, Art II, Sec 35 
35. Workmen's compensation.
 For the purpose of providing compensation to workmen and their dependents, for death, injuries or occupational disease, occasioned in the course of such workmen's employment, laws may be passed establishing a state fund to be created by compulsory contribution thereto by employers, and administered by the state, determining the terms and conditions upon which payment shall be made therefrom. Such compensation shall be in lieu of all other rights to compensation, or damages, for such death, injuries, or occupational disease, and any employer who pays the premium or compensation provided by law, passed in accordance herewith, shall not be liable to respond in damages at common law or by statute for such death, injuries, or occupational disease. Laws may be passed establishing a board which may be empowered to classify all occupations, according to their degree of hazard, to fix rates of contribution to such fund according to such classification, and to collect, administer and distribute such fund, and to determine all right of claimants thereto. Such board shall set aside as a separate fund such proportion of the contributions paid by employers as in its judgment may be necessary, not to exceed one percent thereof in any year, and so as to equalize, insofar as possible, the burden thereof, to be expended by such board in such manner as may be provided by law for the investigation and prevention of industrial accidents and diseases. Such board shall have full power and authority to hear and determine whether or not an injury, disease or death resulted because of the failure of the employer to comply with any specific requirement for the protection of the lives, health or safety of employees, enacted by the General Assembly or in the form of an order adopted by such board, and its decision shall be final; and for the purpose of such investigations and inquiries it may appoint referees. When it is found, upon hearing, that an injury, disease or death resulted because of such failure by the employer, such amount as shall be found to be just, not greater than 50 nor less than 15% of the maximum award established by law, shall be added by the board, to the amount of the compensation that may be awarded on account of such injury, disease, or death, and paid in like manner as older awards; and, if such compensation is paid from the state fund, the premium of such employer shall be increased in such amount, covering such period of time as may be fixed, as will recoup the state fund in the amount of such additional award, notwithstanding any and all other provisions in this constitution. (As amended November 6, 1923. To take effect January 1, 1924.)

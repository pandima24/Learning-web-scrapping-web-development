A. Scope
1. This rule does all of the following:
a. Establishes procedures by which the employer shall furnish, or cause to be furnished, to an employee who receives a personal injury arising out of and in the course of employment, reasonable and necessary medical, surgical, and hospital services and medicines, or other attendance or treatment recognized by the laws of the state as legal, when needed. The employer shall also supply to the injured employee dental services, crutches, artificial limbs, eyes, teeth, eyeglasses, hearing apparatus, and other appliances necessary to cure, so far as reasonably and necessarily possible, and relieve from the effects of the injury.
b. Establishes schedules of maximum fees by a health facility or health care provider for such treatment or attendance, service, device, apparatus, or medicine.
c. Establishes procedures by which a health care provider shall be paid the lesser of (1) the provider's usual charge, or (2) the maximum fee established under this rule, or (3) the MCO/PPO contracted price, where applicable.
d. Provides for the identification of utilization of health care and health services above the usual range of utilization for such services, based on medically accepted standards, and provides for acquiring by a carrier and by the Medical Cost Containment Division (MCCD) of the necessary records, medical bills, and other information concerning any health care or health service under review.
e. Establishes a system for the evaluation by a carrier of the appropriateness in terms of both the level of and the quality of health care and health services provided to injured employees, based upon medically accepted standards.
f. Authorizes carriers to withhold payment from or recover payment from, health facilities or health care providers which have made excessive charges or which have required unjustified and/or unnecessary treatment, hospitalization, or visits.
g. Provides for the review by the Commission of the records and medical bills of any health facility or health care provider which has been determined not to be in compliance with this rule or to be requiring unjustified and/or unnecessary treatment, hospitalization or office visits.
h. Establishes that when a health care facility or health care provider provides health care or health care service that is not usually associated with, is longer in duration than, is more frequent than, or extends over a greater number of days than that health care or service usually does with the diagnosis or condition for which the patient is being treated, the health care provider may be required by the carrier to explain the necessity in writing.
i. Provides for the implementation of the MCCD review and decision responsibility. The rule and definitions are not intended to supersede or modify the workers' compensation laws, the administrative rules of the Commission, or court decisions interpreting the laws or the Commission's administrative rules.
j. Provides for the certification of carriers determined to be in compliance with the criteria and standards established by this rule in their utilization review of services and charges by health care facilities and health care providers.
k. Establishes maximum fees for depositions/witnesses.
l. Establishes maximum fees for medical reports.
m. Provides for uniformity of billing for provider services.
n. Establishes the effective date for implementation of Rule 30.
o. Adopts by reference as part of this rule the Medical Fee Schedule and any amendments to that fee schedule.
p. Establishes procedures for balance billing.

Establishes procedures for preauthorization of nonemergency hospitalizations, transfers between facilities, and outpatient services expected to exceed $1,000.00 in billed charges for a single date of service by a provider. (See Arkansas Workers' Compensation Commission Inpatient Hospital Fee Schedule Part III.)
2. An independent medical examination performed to evaluate legal liability of a case, or for purposes of litigation of a case, shall be exempt from this rule.
B. Procedure Codes
1. Services must be coded with valid procedure or supply codes of the Health Care Financing Administration Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS). Procedure codes used in Rule 30 were developed and copyrighted by the American Medical Association.
2. The most current edition of the Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) should be used for Rule 30 Guidelines.
C. Procedures For Which Codes Are Not Listed
1. If a procedure is performed which is not listed in the Medicare Resource Based Relative Value Scale (RBRVS), the health care provider must use an appropriate CPT procedure code. The provider must submit an explanation, such as copies of operative reports, consultation reports, progress notes, office notes or other applicable documentation, or description of equipment or supply (when that is the charge).
2. The CPT contains procedure codes for unlisted procedures. These codes should only be used when there is no procedure code which accurately describes the service rendered. A special report is required as these services are reimbursed BR (By Report).
3. Reimbursement by the carrier for BR procedures should be based upon the carrier's review of the submitted documentation, the recommendations from the carrier's medical consultant, and the carrier's review of the prevailing charges for similar services as identified by the carrier based on data which is representative of Arkansas charges.
D. Modifier Codes
1. Modifiers listed in the CPT shall be added to the procedure code when the service or procedure has been altered from the basic procedure described by the descriptor.
2. The use of modifiers does not imply or guarantee that a provider will receive reimbursement as billed. Reimbursement for modified services or procedures must be based on documentation of reasonableness and necessity and must be determined on a case-by-case basis.
3. When Modifier 21, 22, or 25 is used, a report explaining the medical necessity of the situation must be submitted to the carrier. It is not appropriate to use Modifier 21, 22, or 25 for routine billing.
E. Total Procedures Billed Separately
Certain diagnostic procedures (neurologic testing, radiology and pathology procedures, etc.) may be performed by two separate entities who also bill separately for the professional and technical components. When this occurs, the total reimbursement must not exceed the maximum medical fee schedule allowable for the 5-digit procedure code listed.
1. When billing for the professional component only, Modifier 26 must be added to the appropriate 5-digit procedure code.
2. When billing for the technical component only, Modifier TC (Technical Component) must be added to the appropriate 5-digit code.

Within twenty-four (24) hours of the observed behavior or before the results of the test are released, whichever is earlier, the Rule 36 employer must make a written record of the observations leading to a controlled substance or alcohol reasonable suspicion test. A copy of this documentation shall be given to the employee upon request, and the original documentation shall be kept confidential by the Rule 36 employer pursuant to Section XII and shall be retained by the Rule 36 employer for at least one (1) years.
3. Routine fitness-for-duty drug or alcohol testing.
a. A Rule 36 employer must require an employee to submit to a drug or alcohol test if, as a part of the employer's written policy, the test is conducted as a routine part of a routinely scheduled employee fitness-for-duty medical examination, or is scheduled routinely for all members of an employment classification or group.
b. A public employer may require scheduled, periodic testing only of employees who:
(1) Are police or peace officers;
(2) Have drug interdiction responsibilities;
(3) Are authorized to carry firearms;
(4) Are engaged in activities which directly affect the safety of others;
(5) Work in direct contact with inmates in the custody of the Department of Correction; or
(6) Work in direct contact with minors who have been adjudicated delinquent or who are in need of supervision in the custody of the Department of Human Services.
c. This rule does not require a drug or alcohol test if a Rule 36 employer's current personnel policy on July 1, 2000, does not include drug or alcohol testing as a part of a routine fitness-for-duty medical exam. If such testing is included, it must be done on a nondiscriminatory manner.
d. Routine fitness-for-duty drug or alcohol testing of employees does not apply to volunteer employee health screenings, employee wellness programs, programs mandated by governmental agencies, or medical surveillance procedures that involve limited examinations targeted to a particular body part or function.
4. Follow-up drug testing. If the employee in the course of employment enters an employee assistance program for drug or alcohol-related problems, or a drug or alcohol rehabilitation program, the Rule 36 employer must require the employee to submit to a drug or alcohol test, as appropriate, as a follow-up to such program, unless the employee voluntarily entered the program. In those cases, the Rule 36 employer has the option to not require followup testing. If follow-up testing is required, it must be conducted at least once a year for a twoyear period after successful completion of the program. Advance notice of a follow-up testing date must not be given to the employee to be tested.
5. Post-accident testing. After an accident which results in an injury, the Rule 36 employer shall require the employee to submit to a drug or alcohol test in accordance with this rule. Post accident specimen collection for alcohol testing shall be done within eight (8) hours of the accident. Post accident specimen collection for drugs shall be done within thirty-two (32) hours of the accident.

I. Authority and Purpose
Pursuant to Act 1281 of 2001, an additional section, Arkansas Code Annotated 11-9-117, has been added to empower the Arkansas Workers' Compensation Commission, in accordance with its rule-making authority, to enact medical diagnostic and treatment guidelines regarding occupational carpal tunnel syndrome. These guidelines are based upon the joint recommendation




===================================================================
--->arkansas--->Arkansas Rules--->Rule 37  Occupational Carpal Tunnel Syndrome--->II. Applicability and Effective Date
===================================================================



 

II. Applicability and Effective Date
This rule and the guidelines set forth herein shall be applicable to all claims for workers' compensation benefits regarding occupational carpal tunnel syndrome filed with the commission on or after September 20, 2001.




===================================================================
--->arkansas--->Arkansas Rules--->Rule 37  Occupational Carpal Tunnel Syndrome--->III. Introduction
===================================================================



 

III. Introduction
Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is caused by compression of the median nerve at the wrist. Occupational CTS (OCTS) assumes a work-relatedness. Compared to non-occupational CTS, OCTS patients are younger and have generally less severe changes on nerve conduction studies (NCS), and are about equally male or female. Diabetes, pregnancy, hypothyroidism, and rheumatoid and other inflammatory arthritides are health problems occasionally associated with CTS.




===================================================================
--->arkansas--->Arkansas Rules--->Rule 37  Occupational Carpal Tunnel Syndrome--->IV. Diagnosis
===================================================================



 

IV. Diagnosis
A. Initially, patients may have mild, intermittent symptoms usually of a few weeks duration without objective signs of median nerve dysfunction. The intermittent symptoms include numbness, tingling or pain in the hand that occur with use of the hand and at night. Patients with persistent CTS have objective findings on examination or symptoms that fail to improve with conservative treatment, usually within four weeks.
B. Clinical Findings
1. Symptoms
a. Paresthesias in the hand  usually the first three digits of the hand. However, patients often don't discriminate between some or all of the digits. Symptoms appropriate to the median nerve distribution are sensitive (0.93 or 7% false negative) but also have low specificity (0.25 or 75% false positives).
b. Pain in the hand, forearm, upper arm.
c. A feeling of weakness or clumsiness of the hand.
2. Signs or objective findings
a. Decreased sensation in the median nerve distribution (two-point discrimination has a sensitivity of 0.23 but a specificity of 0.82).
b. Weakness is usually difficult to demonstrate in mild CTS. Thenar atrophy indicates more severe CTS.
c. Tinel's sign (sensitivity = 0.62, specificity = 0.66).
d. Phalen's sign (sensitivity = 0.73, specificity = 0.36).      e. Abnormal nerve conduction studies. f. Even in patients with NCS-established OCTS, the exam may be normal. 3. If the NCS changes are mild to moderate, conservative management with splinting, medication, and job modification could be continued for four to eight weeks. 4. Surgical decompression of the carpal tunnel (carpal tunnel release) is considered if there is: a. Failure to improve with conservative management and there are corroborative NCS findings, or b. Progression of symptoms during conservative management and there are corroborative NCS findings, or c. Atrophy or significant NCS abnormality. 5. In general, if a patient has symptoms that are thought to be from OCTS but has no objective verification of OCTS, including no abnormality on NCS, then that patient has likely reached maximum medical improvement at no longer than eight weeks of conservative management under the care of a medical or osteopathic physician.
e. Abnormal nerve conduction studies.
f. Even in patients with NCS-established OCTS, the exam may be normal.
3. If the NCS changes are mild to moderate, conservative management with splinting, medication, and job modification could be continued for four to eight weeks.
4. Surgical decompression of the carpal tunnel (carpal tunnel release) is considered if there is:
a. Failure to improve with conservative management and there are corroborative NCS findings, or
b. Progression of symptoms during conservative management and there are corroborative NCS findings, or
c. Atrophy or significant NCS abnormality.
5. In general, if a patient has symptoms that are thought to be from OCTS but has no objective verification of OCTS, including no abnormality on NCS, then that patient has likely reached maximum medical improvement at no longer than eight weeks of conservative management under the care of a medical or osteopathic physician.




===================================================================
--->arkansas--->Arkansas Rules--->Rule 37  Occupational Carpal Tunnel Syndrome--->V. Nerve Conduction Studies
===================================================================



 

V. Nerve Conduction Studies
A. Nerve conduction studies are the recognized standard for the diagnosis of CTS. The following recommended criteria are adapted from those of the State of Washington Department of Labor & Industry. Other criteria may be utilized as long as such criteria have a sound basis in the peer-reviewed literature.
1. Median palmar latencies (palm to wrist at 8 cm.) Abnormal latency > 2.2 msecs. Median minus ulnar palmar latency abnormal > 0.3 msecs.
2. Median motor latency (wrist to APB at 8 cm.) Abnormal latency > 4.5 msecs. Median minus ulnar motor distal latency abnormal > 1.8 msecs.
3. Median sensory distal latency (wrist to digit at 14 cm.) Abnormal latency > 3.5 msecs.
4. Fourth digit sensory distal latency (wrist to digit at 14 cm.) Median minus ulnar sensory latency difference abnormal > 0.5 msecs.
B. In general, a complete study would include median and ulnar palmar latencies and median and ulnar motor nerve conduction studies, with hand skin temperature > 30 degrees C. No more than 10% of CTS patients will have normal standard NCS. These patients likely have mild median nerve impingement that may occur only with use of the hand. EMG is rarely needed for the diagnosis of CTS. If there is prominent concern for cervical radiculopathy, structural studies might be indicated.
       




===================================================================
--->arkansas--->Arkansas Rules--->Rule 37  Occupational Carpal Tunnel Syndrome--->VI. Work-relatedness
===================================================================



 

VI. Work-relatedness
A. Carpal tunnel syndrome occurs both from intrinsic or patient factors (e.g. small carpal tunnel from arthritis or congenitally, metabolic derangement, etc.) and extrinsic factors, which for Occupational CTS would be job activities. That is, if the predominant cause of the CTS is from job activity, then the CTS is work-related.
B. Job activity that regularly requires extensive use of the hands may be an appropriate exposure. Such activity involves repetitive hand use, especially:
1. for prolonged periods;
2. against force;
3. with strongly vibrating equipment;
4. with repeated wrist flexion, extension, deviation, forearm rotation, or constant firm gripping;
5. or, with awkward hand or wrist positions.




===================================================================
--->arkansas--->Arkansas Rules--->Rule 37  Occupational Carpal Tunnel Syndrome--->VII. Management
===================================================================



 

VII. Management
A. Initial Management
1. Wrist splinting to maintain the wrist in a neutral position at night and when the hand is engaged in substantial activity.
2. Medicationusually an NSAID.
3. Job modification.
4. Steroid injection into the carpal tunnel may offer short-term improvement, but only 22% maintain the improvement (in a non-occupational CTS setting).
A short, tapering course of oral corticosteroid has been shown to offer significant symptomatic improvement in patients with mild to moderate CTS. (Neurology, 1988, 51:390-393).
B. Progress
If there is failure to improve with initial management, or if there is a more severe presentation of pain, swelling, weakness, or numbness, then more aggressive measures may be needed, including nerve conduction studies. Nerve conduction studies (NCS) or specialist referral are obtained when there is:
1. Failure to have improvement of symptoms after four weeks of conservative management, or
2. Progression of symptoms during treatment, or
3. Significant abnormality on examination, especially atrophy, or
4. Time loss on the job.
The NCS are likely to be more sensitive if performed when the patient is still engaged in his usual occupation under normal working conditions.

5. Contingent Liability - the amount that a Self-Insurer's fund may be obliged to pay in excess of a given fund year's standard premium collected or on hand. This liability is considered funded if a security deposit equal to the total amount of the contingent liability has been posted. This liability is considered unfunded if a surety bond has been posted equal to all or a portion of the total amount of the contingent liability.
6. Current Ratio - the ratio of current assets to current liabilities as shown in the most recent financial statement.
7. Group - Common Self-Insurer or Homogeneous Self-Insurer.

12. Third Party Administrator - a business which has met all the requirements of Commission Rule 099.38 and has received authorization from the Commission to act as a third party administrator.

B. Acceptable Securities
1. The securities acceptable to the Commission as a security deposit shall be certificates of deposit issued by a state chartered bank or a national chartered bank in the State of Arkansas. The securities acceptable to the Commission as a security deposit shall include surety bonds in a form prescribed by the Commission which are issued by any corporate surety which meets the qualifications prescribed in Part I, B, 2 of this rule. The securities acceptable to the Commission as a security deposit shall also include letters of credit in a form prescribed and approved by the Commission. These three approved methods of posting security must follow strict compliance with this rule.
2. Any corporate surety, to be eligible for writing self-insurers' bonds in the State of Arkansas, shall be an admitted or approved carrier by the Insurance Commissioner of the State of Arkansas to transact such a business in the state, and its latest financial statement on file with the Insurance Commissioner shall at all times show assets, including surplus to policyholders, at least equal to the latest Insurance Commissioner requirement for admission of a new company to do business in the State. Any securities held by the Commission may be exchanged or replaced by the depositor with other securities of like nature and amount. Any surety bond may be exchanged or replaced with another surety bond provided the required sixty (60) day notice of termination of liability is given to the Commission. Whenever an employer discontinues business in the state or desires to terminate his status as a self-insurer, or desires to replace securities with a Surety Bond, he shall so notify the Commission and may recover the securities deposited with the Commission upon posting in lieu thereof a special release bond issued by a corporate surety in an amount equal to the total value of such securities. The special release bond shall cover all existing liabilities under the laws and shall remain in force for a period in accordance with the statute of limitations as specified in the Act, and until such time, to be determined by the Commission, as all obligation under the Act have been fully discharged. The Commission shall be authorized to bring suit upon any surety bond so posted, to procure prompt payment of compensation liabilities.
3. Self-insurers shall make all funded securities payable to the Arkansas Workers' Compensation Commission, in trust for (name of depositor) as per Commission requirements. All such securities shall be filed with the Workers' Compensation Commission for deposit with the Treasurer of the State of Arkansas under custody receipt. No other depository is acceptable. The Commission shall be authorized to sell and/or collect the securities in whole or in part, in the case of actual or imminent default of the employer or group, to pay compensation liabilities. Interest accruing on any negotiable securities so deposited shall be collected and transmitted to the depositor, provided he is not in default in payment of compensation benefits or the annual premium tax. All pre-funded deposits shall remain in the custody of the Commission for a period of time as the statute of limitations provided in the laws may dictate, and until such time as all obligations of the employer or group have been fully discharged, such time to be determined by the Commission.
4. The Commission permits deposit of an ï¿½Irrevocable Standby Letter of Creditï¿½ as an alternative security deposit. The Commission will furnish upon request the prescribed and approved forms for use in utilizing this alternative. The Commission requires that an irrevocable standby letter of credit be accepted only from state chartered banks or national chartered banks with offices in the State of Arkansas. Banks eligible for use must be covered under the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and must be acceptable to the Commission. Letters of credit issued by a bank that do not meet the standard as mandated by this rule may be accepted by the Commission with a confirming letter of credit issued by a bank meeting the prescribed criteria. The Commission shall be authorized to make demand and collect on the posted letter of credit in whole or in part, in the case of actual or imminent default of the employer or group to pay compensation liabilities. All ï¿½Irrevocable Standby Letters of Creditï¿½ shall remain in the custody of the Commission for a period of time as the statute of limitations provided in the laws may dictate, and until such time as all obligations of the employer or group have been fully discharged, such time to be determined by the Commission.
C. Filings of Reports - Penalties
1. Each individual self-insurer or group shall file premium tax reports, financial statements, summary loss data and such other reports and statements at such time and in such manner as the Commission shall require. This rule places this responsibility on the employers, groups and service companies to perform their prescribed duties and responsibilities without prompting from the Commission. Failure or refusal of any self-insurer or group to file the prescribed reports with the Commission within the prescribed time period shall subject the mentioned self-insurer to a civil penalty in such amount as the Commission may prescribe, not to exceed one hundred ($100) per infraction per day, and shall be sufficient cause for the revocation of the self-insurer privilege. Failure to pay such penalty within thirty (30) days of notification shall be considered good cause for revocation of the self-insurer privilege.
2. The Commission shall require annual or otherwise periodic payroll audits from each employer, or group of employers, self-insured under the laws to determine the proper assessment for tax purposes. The amount of tax shall be based upon the written manual premium for the calendar year in question. The tax is limited by law at three (3) percent of the tabulated written manual premium for each self-insurer. Each Individual self-insurer or group shall maintain a true and accurate payroll record, which shall be made available during reasonable business hours, upon demand, to the Commission and its authorized representatives. Unless payroll records are maintained in such manner that a true and accurate division by workers' compensation classification codes can readily be determined for proper rating, the entire payroll shall be presumed to be within the classification to which the highest insurance rate is applicable. If such audits reveal a deficiency in the amounts reported to the Commission or amounts paid to the Commission, the Commission may assess the cost of such audit against such self-insurer. This audit report and payment of the proper tax is due on or before April 1 of each year.
3. Each individual self-insurer and group shall file annual statements of financial condition with the Commission in a form acceptable to the Commission. Individual Self-Insurers must maintain a level of financial strength, financial position, and financial ratios that would be required of any new applicant. These statements must be prepared by a certified public accountant and must be certified audits, except that an individual self-insurer may be allowed to submit another type of statement acceptable to the Commission. Public employers entering the individual self-insurance program may satisfy these requirements by furnishing independent certified audits or by furnishing the most current audit report as prepared by the Legislative Joint Auditing Committee. Any less requirements of these annual statements will be at the discretion of the Commission. An additional security deposit or surety bond may be required in the absence of a certified audit. Interim financial reports may be required in addition to these annual financial statements at the discretion of the Commission. This report is due on or before April 1 of each year.
4. Summary Loss Data will be filed with the Commission by each individual self-insurer or group self-insurer under the laws. This report shall be filed with the Commission on an annual basis, or on a quarterly basis, or on any interim basis as prescribed by the Commission. This report will be due within thirty (30) days after each prescribed evaluation period, and unless otherwise directed, this report will be due not later than February 1 of each year. This self-insurers' statement on this report will be on a form prescribed by the Commission, and any substitute form must contain all the requested data. This report will include but not be limited to the name of the employer, name of the injured employee, claim number, date of accident, nature of injury, amounts paid on the claim for indemnity, medical, expenses, and outstanding reserves, if any. This report will cover all incurred losses of the evaluation period as well as any pending claims where any type payment is made or reserve is pending. This report will require reasonable reserves on all open pending claims.
D. Contracts for Excess Insurance
1. Aggregate and specific excess insurance with liability limits and retention amounts acceptable to the Commission may be required as a condition of approval of any individual self-insurer or group self-insurer as hereinafter provided, except qualifying public employer self-insurer groups are entitled to statutory options and limitations.
2. Any casualty insurance company to be eligible to write excess liability coverage for individual self-insurers or group self-insurers in the State of Arkansas, shall at all times meet the same standard as required of any corporate surety as outlined in Part I, B 2.
3. No contract or policy of excess insurance shall be recognized by the Commission in considering the ability of an applicant to fulfill its financial obligation under the workers' compensation laws unless such contract or policy:
a. Is issued by a recognized, admitted or approved casualty insurance company with the minimum qualifications established by these rules.
b. May not be cancelled except upon thirty (30) days written notice by registered or certified mail to the other party to the policy and the Arkansas Workers' Compensation Commission.
c. Is renewable at the expiration of the policy period unless written notice by registered or certified mail is given to the other party to the policy and the Arkansas Workers' Compensation Commission, thirty (30) days prior to such expiration, by the party desiring to cancel or not to renew the policy.
d. If it contains any type of commutation clause, provided (1) that any commutation effected thereunder shall not relieve the underwriter(s) of further liability as respects claims and expenses unknown at the time of such commutation or in regard to claims apparently closed but which may be subsequently revived by or through a competent authority, and (2) that in the event the underwriter proposes to redeem any future payments payable as compensation for accidents occurring during the term of the policy by the payment of a lump sum to be fixed as provided in the commutation clause of the policy, provided not less than thirty (30) days prior notice of such commutation shall be given to the Arkansas Workers' Compensation Commission by registered or certified mail by the underwriter(s) or their agent.
e. In the event any commutation is permitted and effected, the Commission shall have the right to direct that such sum either (1) be placed in trust for the benefit of the injured employee(s) entitled to such future payments of compensation, or (2) be invested in approved securities and deposited with the Commission to assure such future payments of compensation to the employee(s) entitled thereto.
f. Contains the provision that obligations due under the terms of the policy shall be made to a party other than the employer, such party to be designated by the Commission if it is deemed to be in the best interest of the employees covered by these laws.
E. Servicing for Self-Insurers - Qualifications
1. Each individual self-insurer or group, as a condition of approval to self-insure, shall be required to provide proof of compliance with the provisions of this section regarding servicing requirements.
a. It shall be the sole responsibility of each individual self-insurer or group to provide for qualified persons to service its program in the areas of claims adjusting, underwriting, safety engineering and loss control. Should the individual self-Insurer or group be unable or unwilling to provide any or all of these services through the use of its own employees, then it shall contract with outside agencies with established qualifications to provide these services.
b. Individual self-insurers and groups may contract for claims adjusting with only those third party administrators approved as such by the Commission.
c. In the case where an individual self-insurer or group elects to contract with an approved third party administrator, the Commission may, at its discretion, choose to use the third party administrator as an intermediary in its dealings with the employer. In the case where no third party administrator is used, the Commission will deal with the employer only.
d. In the case where an individual self-insurer or group elects to contract with an approved third party administrator, the self-insurer or group shall notify the Commission in writing prior to the effective date of said contract.
e. In order to represent a group self-insurer client, the third party administrator must maintain an Arkansas claims office and have at least one resident adjuster with check authority.
f. Each individual self-insurer or group shall designate a claim office in accordance with Commission Rule 099.29. Notice shall be provided to the Commission prior to any changes in the designated claim office.
F. Revocation or Termination of the Self-Insurer Privilege
1. Failure to comply with any of the rules or with any order of the Commission within the time prescribed shall be considered good cause for revocation or termination of self-insurer privilege, within the meaning of A.C.A. 11-9-404. Noncompliance with any of the provisions of the Workers' Compensation laws, particularly those relating to time and method of compensation payments, the furnishing of medical treatment and filing of accident and compensation reports and failure to pay any assessment, shall likewise be deemed good cause. The Commission shall give written notice of such revocation or termination to the employer and/or his agent(s). The employer shall have fifteen (15) days from the date of mailing of the notice to request a hearing on the revocation or termination. Failure to request a hearing within the time prescribed shall result in the revocation or termination becoming effective thirty (30) days from the date of mailing of the original notice. In no event shall any revocation or termination become effective prior to the date that a hearing on the question is scheduled. Such notice shall be served personally or by certified or registered mail upon all interested parties. This review and appeal process will also be applied to application issues.
2. It will be necessary for a self-Insurer to notify the Commission if the status of the self-insurer is materially changed (individual ownership to partnership or to corporation, merger, etc.) at which time the new entity shall be required to qualify. In the event there is a change in majority ownership of a self-insurer, the self-insurer privilege granted to an individual self-insurer shall be at the discretion of the Commission.
G.

Any application submitted with less than thirty (30) days remaining before the desired effective date may be rejected without further consideration. The application shall be made on forms prescribed by the Commission and shall contain answers to all questions propounded and shall be under oath.
1. The application as submitted by the trustees of the self-insurer group shall be accompanied by:
a. An indemnity agreement jointly and severally binding the group and each member thereof to comply with the provisions of the Arkansas Workers' Compensation laws and Rules and Regulations of the Commission. The indemnity agreement requirement mentioned here and elsewhere in this rule is not applicable to public employer groups.
b. Individual application of each member of the group applying for membership in the self-insurer group on the inception date of the Group.
c. Current financial statements supported by a certified audit of at least two (2) members showing the combined net worth of these members applying for self-insurer status on the inception date of the group self-insurer to be not less than one million dollars ($1,000,000), a combined current ratio of more than 1 to 1 (1:1) and a working capital of an amount establishing financial strength and liquidity of the business to pay normal compensation claims promptly and showing evidence of the financial ability of the group to meet its obligation under the laws. For members joining the group self-insurer after inception date or any time after initial qualification of the group, a certified audited financial statement shall not be required of any member of a group either for initial membership or as a condition for continued membership, however, such certified audited financial statement will be accepted. For members joining an established private employer self-insurer group they may provide in lieu of a certified audited financial statement, a statement, certified by the president and treasurer of the member in the case of a corporation, and by the owner and general partners, respectively, in the case of an individual proprietorship or partnership, to the effect that such financial statement is true and correct to the best of the knowledge and belief of the signing authorities. However, the Commission may at its discretion grant a waiver to the requirement that financial statements be submitted as part of the application process for new members. The waivers will be issued on a group by group basis depending on the financial stability of the group and the Group's consistent adherence to the Laws and Rules of the Commission. For members joining an established public employer self-insurer group, they may provide in lieu of a certified audited financial statement, a statement prepared by the Legislative Joint Auditing Committee or a financial statement certified by the member entity executive head and the member entity treasurer in the same manner as required of private employer members.
d. A set of by-laws governing the operation of the group self-Insurer shall conform to the conditions specified in Part III, D 1.

f. Each group self-insurer shall satisfy the Commission that it has complied with the requirements of the appropriate guaranty fund.
2. Each group self-insurer shall satisfy the Commission that it has complied with the provisions of Part I, E 1 before approval for self-insurer status may be granted by the Commission. In addition, the Commission may require periodic proof that the self-insurer is complying with these standards on a continuing basis.
3. An investigation and study of the financial and other capabilities of the group applicant to meet its obligation under the law, will be conducted by the Self- Insurance Division of the Commission. The Self-Insurance Division of the Commission will submit an evaluation report to the Commission, after which formal approval for self-insurer status may be granted by the Commission.
4. Subsequent to the inception date of the group self-insurer, prospective new members of the group self-insurer shall submit an application on a form prescribed by the Commission for membership to the board of trustees. The trustees must approve the application for membership in accordance with these rules and the terms of the indemnity agreement for the application to be binding upon the group self-insurer and prospective members. The application for membership shall then be filed with the Commission thirty (30) days prior to the desired effective date of self-insurer status. The Commission may authorize groups to issue binders whereby the trustees may "bind" coverage for an individual member for a period of thirty (30)days. If such a binder has been issued, the trustees must file a copy of the binder with the Commission within five (5) days of issuance and submit a completed application with supporting documents to the Workers' Compensation Commission, Self- Insurance Division within fifteen(15) days of the effective date of coverage. At no time shall coverage be extended, by means of a binder, whereby the effective date of coverage precedes the issue date by more than ten (10) days. Failure of a group to meet the requirements regarding the issuance of binders and/or the submission of applications may subject the group to the loss of authority to issue binders and shall be sufficient grounds for denying an application. The Commission retains the right to reject the admission of any new member.
B. Minimum Security Deposit For Group Self-Insurer
Each group self-insurer, pursuant to A.C.A. 11-9-404, shall deposit and maintain with the Commission acceptable securities or post a surety bond issued by a corporate surety duly authorized to do business in the State of Arkansas, in an amount determined by the Commission, but not less than two hundred thousand dollars ($200,000.00). The amount of the security deposit or bond shall be determined at least annually based on net safety factors, contingent liabilities, growth of the group, and other data as submitted by the group self-insurers to the Commission. The amount of the security deposit or bond requirement mentioned here and elsewhere in this rule is not applicable to public employer groups.
C. Group Self-Insurers' Funds and Surplus
1. Each group self-insurer shall consist of two (2) separate funds, that is, the trustee fund and a common claim fund. All premiums and assessments charged to the member are paid into the trustee fund. The trustee fund shall be used to pay the operational expenses of the group self-insurer.
2. From the trustee fund there shall be created a separate common claim fund. The common claim fund shall be placed in a designated depository, and this fund will be maintained at all times by the authorized service organization or the designated adjuster or individual(s) charged with the handling and payment of claims. This fund shall be adequate to cover any current incurred and contingent liabilities as imposed by the laws.
3. Employers participating in a group self-insurer shall pay the standard premium or percent thereof as designated by the group and approved by the Commission, with exceptions being when at the discretion of the group manager or fiscal agent of the group it becomes necessary to surcharge or assess all members because of the loss experience of the group.

c. Requiring of the accounts and records of the Group to be audited annually or at any time as may be required by the Commission, such audits to be made by certified public accountants or by authorized representatives of the Commission, with the Commission reserving the right to prescribe a uniform accounting system to be used by group self-insurers and/or service organizations, and the type of audits to be made, in order that it may determine the solvency of the group self-insurer. Copies of audits prepared by those other than Commission personnel shall be filed with the Self-Insurance Division of the Commission within three (3) months after the close of the fiscal year.
d. The trustee or fiscal agent or group manager shall not utilize any of the funds collected as premium for any purpose unrelated to workers' compensation.

An Administrative Law Judge who declines to approve a proposed settlement by Joint Petition may disqualify himself from further action in that docket and related dockets. (Effective date April 1, 1989)

--->arkansas--->Arkansas Rules--->Rule 32 Hazardous Employer Program
===================================================================



 

RULE 099.32 HAZARDOUS EMPLOYER PROGRAM #099.32
I. CRITERIA FOR IDENTIFYING HAZARDOUS EMPLOYERS
A. The Health and Safety Division (HSD) of the Arkansas Workers' Compensation Commission (the Commission) pursuant to Ark. Code Ann. Section 11-9-409(c) shall identify hazardous employers based on criteria established by the Commission in this rule. Each employer identified, continued, or monitored shall have the right to verify employment, illness, and injury data used by the HSD, obtain a review of the findings of the HSD by the Chief Executive Officer (C.E.O.) Of the Commission, and request a hearing before the Full Commission to contest the findings of the C.E.O. A request for review by the C.E.O. or hearing before the Full Commission shall be in writing, setting out the grounds therefore, and shall be filed within fifteen (15) days of the action from which the request is made. The C.E.O. or the Full Commission, as applicable, shall decide the issues within fifteen (15) days of receipt of the request for review or hearing.
DEFINITIONS:
1. Number of Employees - Number of employees reported to the Arkansas Department of Workforce Services. Volunteers, elected officials, and board members of public entities shall not be counted.
2. Incident - A work-related illness or injury for which compensation is paid, as set out in Ark. Code Ann. Section 11-9-501. For an illness or injury to be compensable, the affected employee must miss eight (8) or more calendar days of work. Each illness or injury which results in permanent partial disability without lost time, shall also be deemed an incident for purposes of this rule. Illness or injuries to volunteers, elected officials, or board members of public entities shall not be counted.
3. Number of Incidents - The total number of incidents reported per employer during a calendar year. The number of incidents will be tabulated on a site-specific basis unless reported by the employer in a different manner.
4. Expected Incidence Rate - The benchmark illness and injury rate for each North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code. The Expected Incident Rate is obtained from data compiled from national statistics as reported to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). Lost work day cases are defined by OSHA/BLS as those illness and injury cases which result in one or more days away from work. Lost work day cases do not include cases where the employee works in restricted or light duty. If data is not available from the BLS publication, other suitable sources are used to determine the Expected Incident Rate.
5. Employer Incidence Rate - Derived for each employer according to the following formula:
(Number of Incidents/Number of Employees) x 100 = Employer Incidence Rate Site-specific computations will be made only if data is reported to the Commission by individual location.
6. Hazard Index - Derived annually and based on the preceding year's incidence rates for each employer according to the following formula: Employer Incidence Rate/Expected Incidence Rate = Hazard Index Site-specific computations will be made only if data is reported to the Commission by individual location.
7. Hazardous Employer - Any employer whose Hazard Index is 1.0 or greater may be identified as a Hazardous Employer. A Hazard Index of 1.0 or greater indicates an Employer Incidence Rate which substantially exceeds the Expected Incidence Rate since Employer Incidence Rates are based on cases which result in eight (8) or more days away from work while Expected Incidence Rates are based on cases which result in one or more days away from work.
B. The following criteria shall be used to evaluate employers and identify Hazardous
Employers:
1. Employer Incident Rates and Hazard Indexes will be calculated annually, based on the preceding year's incidence rates.
2. When possible, employers with multiple locations in the state shall be evaluated by individual sites or locations and a Hazard Index will be determined for each individual site or location. Site-specific evaluation is possible only if data is reported to the Commission by individual site location.
3. No employer who has only one incident in any single calendar year will be identified as a Hazardous Employer. However, if two or more incidents occur in any single calendar year, all incidents occurring during that year will be used to calculate the Employer Incident Rate and Hazard Index.
4. A Hazard Index of 1.0 or greater indicates an employer whose illness and injury frequencies during the period evaluated substantially exceeded those that may reasonably be expected in that employer?s business or industry, since Employer Incidence Rates are based only on those cases which result in eight (8) or more days away from work while Expected Incidence Rates are based on cases which result in one or more days away from work.
5. Employers identified as Hazardous Employers will be ranked in descending order (from highest to lowest) based on their Hazard Index, with priority attention given to the higher Hazard Indexes.
C. Employers with a Hazard Index of less than 0.9 will not receive official notification from the HSD of their status. They may request this information by contacting the HSD by telephone, letter or fax.
D. Employers with a Hazard Index of 0.9 to 0.99 will receive a courtesy letter from the HSD notifying them of their status. This letter will be sent to the employer only. The letter may contain the following information:
1. Notification that the employer is close to the 1.0 Hazard Index for Hazardous Employer designation.
2. Programs available from the Arkansas Workers' Compensation Commission and Arkansas Department of Labor, at no cost to the employer, designed to assist employers to improve their overall health and safety programs, prevent illness and injuries, and decrease their incident rate.
E. All employers with a Hazard Index of 1.0 or higher will be issued a Warning Notice. Such notice shall be in writing and sent to the specific site the employer's central/corporate headquarters, and the insurance carrier. The notice may include the following information:
1. Notification that the employer meets the criteria to be identified as a Hazardous Employer and may be placed in the Hazardous Employer Program during the twelve (12) months following the notification.
2. Data (including number of employees, number of incidents and Expected Incident Rate) used to determine the Hazard Index.
3. Programs available from the Arkansas Workers' Compensation Commission and Arkansas Department of Labor, at no cost to the employer, designed to assist employers improve their overall safety programs, prevent illness and injuries, and decrease their incident rate.
II. NOTICE TO HAZARDOUS EMPLOYERS
A. Upon a determination by the HSD that an employer should be classified as hazardous, the HSD shall notify the employer and the employer's workers' compensation insurance carrier. The notice shall be sent to:
1. The employer by certified mail at the employer's principal place of business; and
2. The loss control department or equivalent of the employer's workers' compensation insurance carrier or third party administrator of record in the Commission's files.
B. The notice shall be in writing and shall inform the employer of the following provisions:
1. State that the employer has been identified as a Hazardous Employer;
2. State the facts on which the identification of the Hazardous Employer is based;
3. Outline the steps the employer is required to take as an identified Hazardous Employer;
4. Inform the employer of the penalties for failure to take steps required under the Hazardous Employer Program.
III. HEALTH AND SAFETY CONSULTATION
A. An employer who receives notification under Subsection II.A. of this Rule must obtain a health and safety consultation within thirty (30) days by an Approved Professional Safety Source (APSS) approved by the HSD for that purpose. The APSS may be from the Arkansas Department of Labor, from the employer's insurance carrier, an employee of the employer, or a private consultant.
B. Upon request, the HSD shall provide a list of available Approved Professional Safety Sources.
C. The APSS shall conduct a hazard survey at each appropriate job site and prepare a hazard survey report. The report shall be in writing in a format prescribed by the Commission and shall include a description of any potentially hazardous conditions or practices identified, along with recommendations for controlling the identified potentially hazardous conditions or practices and projected dates of correction.
D. The hazard survey report(s) and any attachments shall be filed by the APSS with the Clerk of the Commission.
E. If the initial consultation and report cannot be completed in the time allowed under this section, the employer may apply in writing to the HSD for a waiver of the time requirements. In no case shall the initial consultation exceed 60 days following the date of notification.
IV. FORMULATION OF HEALTH AND SAFETY PLAN
A. Employers who receive notification under Subsection II.A. will develop a health and safety plan within 30 days of the date of the APSS' initial report with the assistance of the same or other Approved Professional Safety Source as referred to in Section III. This plan must be consistent with accepted industry practices. The Health and Safety plan shall include, but need not be limited to, the following:
1. Management component - Including a written safety policy statement and assignment, by position or title, of health and safety responsibilities and authority;
2. Analysis component - Including identified operational, health and safety hazards;
3. Program record keeping system component;
4. Safety and health education and training component;
5. Safety and health audit/inspection component - Including identification, by title or position, of a qualified person(s) to conduct the audits/inspections;
6. Incident investigation component - Including procedures to identify factors contributing to near-misses and accidents and institute corrective measures; and,
7. Periodic review and revision of the health and safety program and operational procedures component - to determine effectiveness of abatement measures.
B. An implementation time line, not to exceed 6 months after the formulation of the plan, shall be developed and included with the plan.
C. If the employer disagrees with any or all of the plan, the employer shall sign the plan and attach a statement containing the specific reasons for disagreement with the plan and proposed alternative solutions to the health and safety issues cited. The HSD will review the areas of disagreement and notify the employer and the APSS of the decision on each area of disagreement.
D. The employer's signature is understood to exclude those areas of the plan for which there is a stated disagreement, pending a final determination by the HSD.
E. The employer will begin implementation of any or all parts of the plan that are not subject to the employer's disagreement. The time lines specified in the plan shall remain in effect for those parts of the plan the employer is directed to implement. During the review of the plan by the HSD, the HSD may direct the employer and the APSS to implement a procedure in lieu of the part of the plan that is in disagreement.
F. The employer shall be responsible for filing the health and safety plan with the HSD within 30 days of the date of the consultant's initial report.
G. Reference material for the development of a health and safety plan may be obtained from the HSD.
V. FOLLOW-UP INSPECTION BY THE HSD
A. Six months after the formulation of the employer's health and safety plan, or earlier when requested by the employer with the concurrence of the APSS, the HSD shall conduct a follow-up inspection to ensure compliance with, and the effectiveness of, the health and safety plan at the employer's premises.
B. The inspection shall be conducted and completed during normal work hours.
C. The employer shall allow the HSD access to the employer's premises, including remote job sites, and employees during normal work hours to conduct the follow-up inspection.
D. At the time of the inspection, the HSD may consider as evidence of compliance, information which includes, but is not limited to, visual verification, written policies and procedures, attendance rosters for training programs, employee interviews, and purchase orders or receipts for equipment or services necessary to support the accident prevention plan.
VI. REPORT OF FOLLOW-UP INSPECTION
A. The employer, the APSS, and the employer's workers' compensation insurance carrier, shall be provided copies of the report of the follow-up inspection by the HSD.
B. The report shall be in writing and shall specify whether the employer has, or has not, implemented the health and safety plan or other acceptable corrective measures approved by the HSD.
C. If the employer is found not to have implemented the health and safety plan, the report shall also contain:
1. A notification that the employer's Hazardous Employer status is being continued;
2. A list of the specific areas of the health and safety plan which have not been implemented;
3. A list of the specific actions required of the employer to correct the identified deficiencies.
VII. REMOVAL FROM HAZARDOUS EMPLOYER STATUS
An employer shall be removed from Hazardous Employer status if, upon inspection the HSD determines that the employer has complied with the terms of the health and safety plan.
VIII. CONTINUATION OF HAZARDOUS EMPLOYER STATUS
A. An employer shall remain on Hazardous Employer status if the employer is found under Section V. of this Rule (Follow-Up Inspection by the HSD) to have failed or refused to implement a health and safety plan or other suitable hazard abatement measures as approved by the HSD.
B. If an employer is not certified for removal from Hazardous Employer status after the follow-up inspection, the employer shall take the actions specified in the follow-up inspection report, or other suitable hazard abatement measures as approved by the HSD, as a condition for removal from Hazardous Employer status.
C. An employer shall file a progress report with the HSD every 60 days until the employer has been removed from Hazardous Employer status. The report shall include:

--->arkansas--->Arkansas Rules--->Rule 34 Impairment Rating Guide
===================================================================



 

IMPAIRMENT RATING GUIDE
GENERAL PROVISIONS.
Pursuant to Ark. Code Ann. Sub.Sec. 11-9-519(h), 11-9-521(h), and 11-9-522(g) (1993) the following rule is hereby established in order to implement an impairment rating guide to be used in the assessment of anatomical impairment.
Purpose.
The purpose of Rule 34 is to establish an impairment rating guide to be used in the assessment of anatomical impairment.
To accomplish this purpose, the Arkansas Workers' Compensation Commission hereby adopts Guides to the Evaluation of Permanent Impairment (4th ed. 1993) published by the American Medical Association exclusive of any sections which refer to pain and exclusive of straight leg raising tests or range of motion tests when making physical or anatomical impairment ratings to the spine. This publication is also known as the
A.M.A. Guides, available from:
Order Department OP025493
				American Medical Association
				P.O. Box 109050
				Chicago, Illinois 60610
This publication is adopted until such time as the Arkansas Workers' Compensation Commission shall develop another impairment rating guide.
Applicability of Rules.
This rule shall be adopted July 1, 1995 and shall be applicable to all services rendered for an injury occurring after July 1, 1993.
Definitions.
1. Objective findings. "Objective findings" are those findings which cannot come under the voluntary control of the patient. When determining physical or anatomical impairment, neither a physician (or any other medical provider) nor an Administrative Law Judge, the Workers' Compensation Commission or the Courts may consider complaints of pain; for the purpose of making physical or anatomical impairment ratings to the spine, straight leg raising tests or range of motion tests shall not be considered objective findings. Medical opinions addressing compensability and permanent impairment must be stated within a reasonable degree of medical certainty. Ark. Code Ann. Sec. 11-9-102(16).

===================================================================



 

ELECTRONIC DATA INTERCHANGE FILINGS
I. Electronic Data Interchange - Definition and Purpose 
A. Definition - The Arkansas Workers' Compensation Commission ("Commission") accepts Electronic Data Interchange ("EDI") transmissions, which allow the filing of data via paperless forms, pursuant to a contractual arrangement with an Insurance Carrier, Commission-approved Self-Insured Employer, Commission-approved Self-Insured Group, Third Party Administrator, or Governmental Entity ("Reporter").
B. Purpose - The intended purpose of accepting electronic transmissions is to allow for a faster and more efficient method of reporting claim information to the Commission. As a result, claims will be processed faster, allowing injured employees benefits to be paid in a more timely fashion.
II. Transmission and Retrieval of Data
A. Specifications
1. Transmission and retrieval of data shall be accomplished via a method designated by the Commission. Such method may include magnetic tape, direct connection, electronic mailbox, or another method agreed upon.
2. Transmission by the Reporter via the specified method is deemed by the Commission to meet the Commission's requirements for transmittal and receipt of document data on behalf of the Reporter, including any requirement that the document be signed by the Reporter or Employer.
3. Transmissions by the Reporter and retrieval by the Commission will be at a time and to a place designated by the Commission.
4. The Commission agrees to access on a timely basis the information transmitted by the Reporter, and to timely acknowledge receipt of the transmission back to the Reporter via telephone, facsimile transmittal, electronic acknowledgement, or other method.
B. Applications
1. Reporters have precise, once-a-week transmission times to deposit forms via the designated method. Transmission times are set forth in each Reporter's contract with the Commission and must be adhered to for efficient exchange of data.
2. Transmission errors shall be timely identified by the Commission and directed to the Reporter.
3. The Commission will cooperate to find satisfactory resolutions should conflicts arise in EDI scheduling.
4. If transmissions occur no more frequently than on a weekly basis, it is possible for a transmission deposited on Monday to be updated prior to its actual transmission to the Commission.
III. EDI Project Specifications
A. Project Stages
1. The EDI Project will occur in two (2) stages: Initial Document Stage, which will consist of EDI transmission of an agreed-upon version of a First Report of Injury; and Subsequent Document Stage, which will consist of EDI transmissions of other documents used by the Commission, or other data retained or sought.
2. Both Stages will consist of two (2) phases: Parallel Production Phase, or testing phase, during which the Reporter will transmit data electronically to the Commission, while concurrently filing the same information via paper reports; and Full Production Stage, which will begin upon the successful completion of the Parallel Production Phase. During this Phase, concurrent testing will discontinue, and the electronic transmission of the data will become standard.
B. Duration - Any Phase of the Project shall begin on or after the date of the written agreement between the Commission and the Reporter, or on a mutually agreed upon date, and shall continue until the Reporter satisfies the Success Criteria set forth below.
C. Success Criteria - Any Phase of the Project shall be considered a success when the Reporter has transmitted data, for a time designated by the Commission, which meets the Acceptance Criteria stated below, and has been accepted by the Commission.
D. Acceptance Criteria - The Commission's Acceptance Criteria is that the information transmitted:
1. Meets the Mandatory Data Elements set forth in the Technical Criteria Format section of this Rule; and
2. Passes the edits as designated in the Technical Criteria Format section of this Rule; and
3. Matches or is more accurate than the paper forms filed by the Reporter to the Commission.
E. Completion of Parallel Production Phase - Upon successful completion of a Parallel Production Phase, the Commission shall notify the Reporter in writing that the Reporter is no longer required to send the corresponding report via paper document to the Commission.
F. Technical Criteria Format - The transmission of forms, as set forth in each contract, requires that all data conform with regard to:
1. Data Elements - All data elements pertaining to any document or report shall be set forth in a corresponding Trading Partner Table, and shall specify whether the element is mandatory, conditional or optional.
2. Technical Edits - All technical edits shall be applied to all documents received electronically to ensure that mandatory elements are always supplied, conditional elements are supplied when appropriate, and that all other data elements meet the prescribed formats and data relationship tests. Documents that fail to pass these edits will be rejected and must be resubmitted once the appropriate changes have been made.
G. EDI transmissions must meet all Technical Edit and Mandatory Data requirements in order to be accepted by the Commission.
H. Any forms received by the Commission which do not meet all Technical Edit and Mandatory Data requirements will be rejected and returned to the Reporter for refiling.
IV. Transmissions to the Commission
A. In order for any form required by the Commission to be "filed," the EDI transmission must first be "accepted." In order for a transmission to be considered "accepted," the transmission must meet the requirements set forth in Section II.
B. First Report of Injury or Illness
1. Commission acceptance of a First Report of Injury or Illness (Form 1) establishes a file, regardless of amount of time lost by a claimant.
2. The acceptance of Form 1 obligates the Reporter to file all additional required forms.
V.Data Retention, Confidentiality and Database Security
A. All data shall be maintained in the Reporter's database for the statutory requirements for retaining such information.
B. Databases transmitted pursuant to an EDI agreement shall be kept privileged and confidential, and any information contained in any electronic record is subject to all existing and applicable laws, rules and regulations regarding confidentiality.
C. Reporters shall not enter any unauthorized data, make any unauthorized alterations to their own data, or access or alter the data of another Reporter.
D. The parties shall have the rights to make use of the information contained in any electronically submitted record as they would have had in the equivalent paper based document.

--->alabama--->Alabama Rules--->Chapter 480-5-1 General Provisions--->480-5-1-.08 Policies And Procedures For Mediation Of Workers' Compensation Disputes By An Ombudsman
===================================================================

 
  480-5-1-.08 Policies And Procedures For Mediation Of Workers' Compensation Disputes By An Ombudsmen. (1) Agreement of Parties - Mediation is a process where the parties to a dispute, with the help of an impartial third party (the "mediator"), attempt to work out a mutually satisfactory settlement of the dispute. Mediation is a process whereby either party may terminate the mediation at any time. Neither the Department of Industrial Relations (DIR) nor any mediator has the power of authority to force the parties to mediate or to accept an agreement or settlement. (2) Initiating the Mediation Process - To begin the mediation process, either party should contact the DIR. When all parties have acknowledged a willingness to mediate, they will then enter into an Agreement to Mediate, and an Ombudsmen shall inform all parties of their rights and responsibilities under the Workers' Compensation Act of Alabama. (3) Appointment of a Mediator - Following an agreement of the parties to mediate, DIR will select a mediator from its ombudsmen. No Person shall serve as a mediator in any dispute in which that person has any financial or personal interest in the result of the mediation. Prior to accepting an appointment, the prospective mediator shall disclose any circumstances likely to create a presumption of bias or interest in the outcome of the proceedings, or prevent a prompt meeting with the parties. The fact that the selected mediator may already have some familiarity with the case through work as an ombudsmen shall not disqualify the ombudsmen as a mediator unless either party objects to such mediator. In the event that a mediator is objected to, the DIR will select a new mediator from its ombudsmen. If a mediator is not able to continue the mediation process once started, the DIR will select another mediator from its ombudsmen. (4) Scheduling - Upon appointment, the mediator will work with the parties to establish the time and location of a mediation session. Additional mediation sessions may be scheduled as agreed by the parties and the mediator. (5) Conduct of Mediation Sessions - Prior to the first scheduled session the mediator may require the parties to provide the mediator with a brief memorandum setting forth the party's position with regard to the issues that need to be resolved. At the direction of the mediator, the memorandum may be exchanged by the parties. (a) At the first session, the parties shall produce all information reasonably required for the mediator to understand the issues presented. The mediator may require either party to supplement this information. (b) At the mediation session(s), the mediator will conduct an orderly settlement negotiation. Parties shall be represented by a person with authority to settle the case. The mediator will be impartial in such proceedings and has no authority to force the parties to agree to a settlement. The mediator may conduct separate meetings (caucus) with each party in order to improve the mediator's understanding of the respective positions of each party or to move the mediation process forward. The mediator shall not disclose to the adverse party confidential information provided by a party unless that party authorizes the disclosure. (6) Authority of Mediator - The mediator does not have authority to impose a settlement upon the parties, but shall attempt to help the parties reach a satisfactory resolution of their dispute. The mediator may direct questions to any of the parties or their representatives to supplement or clarify information. Whenever necessary, the mediator may obtain expert advice concerning technical aspects of the dispute. Arrangements for obtaining such advice shall be made by the mediator or by the parties. The mediator is authorized to end the mediation whenever, in the judgment of the mediator, further efforts at mediation would not contribute to a resolution of the dispute between the parties. (7) Privacy - Mediation sessions are private. The parties and their representatives may attend mediation sessions. Other persons may attend only with permission of the parties and with the consent of the mediator. (8) Confidentiality - The mediator shall not divulge information disclosed to the mediator by the parties or by witnesses in the course of mediation. All records, reports, or other documents received by a mediator or prepared by the mediator while serving as a mediator shall be considered confidential. The mediator shall not be compelled in any adversary proceeding or judicial forum to divulge the contents of such documents or the fact that such documents exist or testify in regard to the mediation. (a) The parties recognize that mediation sessions are settlement negotiations and that all offers, promises, conduct and statements, whether written or oral, made in the course of the proceedings are confidential and inadmissible in any litigation or arbitration of their dispute, including, but not limited to: views expressed or settlement suggestions made by the parties or the mediator; admissions made by any party; responsibility for termination or failure of the mediation process; or the fact that one party backed out of a settlement before it became binding on the parties. By participating in the mediation process; or the fact that one party backed out of a settlement before it became binding on the parties. By participating in the mediation process, the parties agree not to subpoena or otherwise require the mediator to testify or produce records, notes or work product in any adversarial proceedings between the parties. Any party that attempts to obtain such confidential information shall, and hereby agrees to, reimburse the mediator and the DIR for all fees and costs associated with resisting said attempts. However, evidence that is otherwise admissible or discoverable shall not be rendered inadmissible or non-discoverable as a result of its use in the mediation session. (b) In the event the parties do reach a settlement agreement during the mediation which becomes final and binding in accordance with the provisions of Section 39 of Act No. 92-537, that settlement agreement will be admissible in court or arbitration proceedings to enforce it. (9) No record - There shall be no formal record made of the mediation proceedings and no recordings or stenographic records shall be made. (10) Counsel - The parties may be represented by an attorney at any stage of the mediation process. An employee shall be advised at the first mediation session of his or her right to be represented by counsel by a writing which shall be notarized. (11) Settlement - If a dispute is resolved in whole or in part during mediation, the ombudsmen shall reduce the agreement in writing, and the ombudsmen and each party shall sign the agreement. The signed agreement shall be binding on all parties unless within 60 days after the agreement is signed a court of competent jurisdiction relieves all parties of the effect of the agreement because of fraud, newly discovered evidence, or other good cause. At the end of said 60 day period, the agreement shall be final and irrevocable. At any time during the 60 day period, the parties may present the settlement agreement to a court of competent jurisdiction for approval in accordance with the Workers' Compensation Act of Alabama. (a) At the first mediation session the employee shall be advised by the ombudsmen in writing which is notarized that he or she have a right to have any settlement or his or her claim reviewed by a court of competent jurisdiction at any time within 60 days after the date of the settlement and that at the end of 60 days the settlement shall be final and irrevocable. (12) Termination - The mediation shall be terminated by the parties reaching a settlement; by a declaration by the mediator to the effect that, in the opinion of the mediator, further efforts at mediation are no longer worthwhile; or by a declaration by any party, at any time, that the mediation proceedings are terminated.

Upon cancellation of self-insurance status, an employer, if legally required to do so, must have and maintain workers' compensation insurance in accordance with the Alabama workers' compensation laws.
(e) The authority to self-insure may be revoked by the Director for financial reasons or for failure of the employer to faithfully discharge his obligations according to the agreements contained in his application for authority to self-insure, or for continued violations of these rules or the workers' compensation laws or other regulations as prescribed by the Director in accordance with Code of Ala. 1975, 25-5-8(d) as last amended. Any such employer shall provide the Director with any and all assistance, material and information, documentation or claims files or claims information which may be reasonably required to enable the Director to determine the total amount of claims liability, including IBNR claims, and outstanding future liabilities incurred by the employer. The cancellation or revocation of the authority to self-insure will be ineffective as to any claims which were incurred by an employer during the period in which the Certificate remained in effect.
(f) Upon cancellation, voluntary or otherwise, or revocation of a self-insurance certificate, any security held by the Director will continue to be held by the director until all Alabama workers' compensation claims have been paid or settled.

--->alabama--->Alabama Rules--->Chapter 480-5-3 Group Self-insurance--->480-5-3-.09 Departmental Intervention
===================================================================

 
  480-5-3-.09 Departmental Intervention.  The Director may involve the trustees in a Fund's day to day management if he/she determines that a Fund is in violation of the Law, these Rules, or is potentially impaired and that the Administrator is unwilling or unable to correct the deficiencies. This rule contemplates the need for the Department to have guidelines under which it may intervene in the management of a Fund in order to ensure its viability or, in the event this is not achievable, provide for its orderly dissolution. Four levels of intervention are described, each with a triggering mechanism and a resolution process. Circumstances, in the discretion of the Director, may require acceleration of the process. Specifically, the Director may choose to initiate intervention at Phase II. (a) Phase I - (Probation). If the Director determines that any violation of these Rules, the Law, or perceived financial impairment cannot be remedied in a timely manner through normal discourse with the Administrator, the Director will call for a meeting with the Fund's Trustees to informally discuss his concerns. All parties will seek to reach consensus on the extent of any violations or financial impairments and on remedial actions to be taken. (b) Phase II - (Remediation). If the Director determines that implementation of Phase I has not satisfied his concerns, or that violations or impairments are so acute as to warrant immediate documentation he may require the Trustees to submit a written remediation plan. The written plan will be negotiated between the Director and the Trustees and will include specific objectives with verifiable and measurable outcomes. The implementation timeline for meeting the objectives of the written plan will be mutually agreed upon and in the event of no agreement the Director will establish time deadlines. (c) Phase III - (Supervision). If written objectives are not achieved in a timely manner, the Director will appoint an employee of the Department to make and/or approve all management and financial decisions of the Fund. The Director's appointee will make all reasonable efforts to resolve all violations and impairments. The principle goal will be ensuring the Fund's existence as a going concern and returning the managerial decision making function to the Trustees. The Director will notify each Fund Participant that the Fund providing its workers' compensation coverage is under Departmental supervision. The notice will contain a brief description of problems leading to this action and an outline of the Department's plans to rehabilitate the Fund. A copy of this notice must be provided to all the individuals or companies that market to prospective Fund Participants. This list of marketing persons will be supplied to the Department by the Fund at such time the Fund is placed in supervision. The Director will determine within one year whether the Fund's rehabilitation is successful. The Director may limit a Fund from writing any new business for a period of time until the supervision is successfully completed. Any Fund which cannot be successfully rehabilitated within one year will be dissolved unless a plan of merger is approved by the Director. (d) Phase IV - (Revocation). If the Director determines that violation or impairments have not been remedied by operation of this Rule, or that the Fund is insolvent, he may revoke the Fund's self-insurance privilege. The Director shall give written notice of such revocation to the Fund and its Service Company. The Fund shall have thirty (30) days from the mailing of the notice to request a hearing on the revocation. Failure to request a hearing within the prescribed time shall result in the revocation becoming effective sixty (60) days from the mailing of the original notice. In no event shall a revocation become effective prior to the date that a hearing (if a hearing is requested) is scheduled. Such notice shall be served personally or by certified or registered mail to the Fund Administrator and to the Fund Trustees. In the event of the insolvency of a Fund, the Director will declare the Fund insolvent and invoke joint and several liability and assess Fund Participants by Fund year such amounts as are necessary to satisfy the liabilities of the Fund. After all the liabilities are satisfied, the Director will order the Trustees to return any unencumbered funds to each Participant in the same proportion as each has been assessed. (e) An administrative action taken by the Department for violation of the Law or these Rules may be appealed by the aggrieved party to the Circuit Court of Montgomery County, Alabama, within thirty (30) days of the effective date of the administrative action.

===================================================================

 
480-5-5-.15 BILL SCREENING.    (1) Global Surgery Fees - Ongoing services prior to surgery shall be covered on a fee-for-services basis. The global surgery allowance shall encompass the actual surgery procedure and normal post-operative services. Post-operative visits after six weeks from the date of surgery shall be reimbursable separately. The six week global period applies only to those codes which have been assigned a 90-day global period by Medicare. Global surgery fees include specialty surgical techniques such as, but not limited to, the use of microscopes, videoscopes or lasers, with the exception of unusual situations or extremely long procedures. Reimbursement, in such cases, shall be handled with appropriate individual consideration for the circumstances. A separate charge for a history and physical examination shall be reimbursable for new patients. Global surgery fee includes any anesthesia administered by the operating surgeon.    (2) Multiple Surgery Procedures    (a) For operations performed by the same physician during the same operative session, at the same operative site, reimbursement shall be made at 100 percent (100%) for the procedure with the highest Workers' Compensation fee schedule allowance and 50 percent (50%) of the approved rate for all additional procedures which are medically necessary and not incidental to the other.    (b) For unrelated operations performed by the same physician in different body areas or systems during the same operative session, the multiple procedure reimbursement rule shall apply independently to each body system when the procedures are medically necessary and not incidental to the other procedures.    (c) When bilateral procedures that require preparation of a separate operative site during the same operative session are performed by the same physician, aggregate reimbursement shall be 180 percent (180%) of the allowance of the unilateral procedure.    (d) Certain codes, by the nature of their description, are never to be billed as primary procedures. The value assigned in the fee schedule has already been reduced as a secondary procedure and, therefore, the procedure should be reimbursed at 100 percent (100%) of the allowance. These codes may be identified by the description in the CPT manual specifying each additional service, i.e., 11001, 63091, 63057.    (3) M.D. Assistant Surgeon - Medicare guidelines shall be used to determine when payment for M.D. assistant surgeon is permitted. Reimbursement amounts shall be determined by multiplying the reimbursement made to the primary surgeon by 25 percent (25%).    (4) Non-M.D. Certified Surgeon's Assistant - Medicare guidelines shall be used to determine situations when payment for non-M.D. Certified Surgeon's Assistant shall be made. Reimbursement amounts shall be made at one-half the rate for M.D. assistant surgeon. Claims shall be billed using the appropriate HCFA modifier indicating services were performed by a non-M.D. Certified Surgeon Assistant.    (5) Supplies and Materials    (a) Certain supplies and materials provided by the physician may be listed and reimbursed separately. Braces and splints are reimbursable when they are provided for the treatment of injuries that do not involve fracture or dislocation care. The appropriate HCPCS code should be used. Braces and splints are reimbursable separately for the treatment of fractures or dislocations only in accordance with CPT guidelines. When requested, the provider shall furnish the payer a copy of the vendor=s invoice for the supply item being billed.    (b) Routine inexpensive supplies such as ace bandages, gauze, tongue depressors, adhesive bandages, ointments or creams used in minimal quantities, etc., are not reimbursable as separate items.    (c) Ointments or creams dispensed in quantities intended for repeated use by the patient are reimbursable separately when properly itemized and appropriate.    (d) Sterile trays used in the process of performing minor office surgical procedures are included in the reimbursement for the procedure itself and are not reimbursable as a separate item.    (6) Minor surgeries and endoscopies:    (a) When the minor surgery or endoscopy is performed at the time of the initial visit and this procedure constitutes the major service rendered during the initial visit, payment shall be only for that procedure code. If Medicare has assigned a surgical procedure 10-day global period, then this procedure shall have a 10-day global period.    (b) If a significant separately identifiable cognitive service is also documented, the appropriate evaluation and management doe (established or new patient) with modifier 25 is reimbursable. Billing for the evaluation and management code is not appropriate, if the physician only identified the need for the minor surgery or endoscopy procedure.    (7) When a procedure has been specified as a separate procedure (CPT-4 procedure code), the following applies:    (a) Some of the listed procedures are commonly carried out as an integral part of a total service, and, therefore, do not warrant a separate identification.    (b) When, however, such a procedure is performed independent of, and is not related to other services, it may be listed as a separate procedure.    (8) Cosurgery and Team Surgery    (a) Cosurgery involves two surgeons usually with different specialties who are performing a single procedure for a specific surgical problem. Payment when reporting the same surgical procedure is allowed at 150 percent (150%), divided between the two surgeons.    (b) Team surgery is when two or more surgeons with different skills are operating for different conditions. The procedure may be performed in the same or different operative site(s) (incisions). Each physician's reimbursement is considered independently. Multiple surgery rules apply to each physician's reimbursement.    (9) Anesthesia Services - Employers/agents or UREs shall utilize the current American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) Relative Value Guide when determining reimbursement for anesthesiology services:    (a) For determination of basic unit values;    (b) Physical status modifier units as identified in the ASA Relative Value Guide;    (c) Qualifying circumstance units as stated in the ASA Relative Value Guide; and    (d) Time units based upon 15-minute increments and/or fraction thereof.   1. Items listed below shall apply when professional fees are billed separately by either an M.D. anesthesiologist or Certified Registered Nurse Anesthetist (CRNA). When professional services are rendered by the M.D. Anesthesiologist or a CRNA who is in the employ of a facility, these professional services for the employed M.D. Anesthesiologist or employed CRNA shall be billed separately from the facility charges.    (i) When the M.D. anesthesiologist personally performs all anesthesia related services, payment shall be made to the M.D. anesthesiologist at 100 percent (100%) of the full fee schedule amount;    (ii) When the CRNA, who is not in the employ of the M.D. Anesthesiologist or facility and is not under the supervision of an M.D. anesthesiologist, personally performs all anesthesia related services, payment shall be made at 65 percent (65%) of the full fee schedule amount to the CRNA; and    (iii) When the M.D. anesthesiologist supervises a CRNA in the employ of the M.D. anesthesiologist, payment shall be as follows:    (I) Payment shall be made at 100 percent (100%) of the full fee schedule amount to the M.D. anesthesiologist; and    (II) No payment shall be made to the CRNA.    2. When the M.D. anesthesiologist supervises a CRNA in the employ of the facility, payment shall be made at 50 percent (50%) of the full fee schedule amount to the M.D. anesthesiologist. Payment for professional services provided by the CRNA shall be made at 50 percent (50%) of the full fee schedule amount and to the facility.    3. When the M.D. anesthesiologist supervises a CRNA who is not in the employ of an M.D. anesthesiologist or facility, payment shall be made at 50 percent (50%) of the full fee schedule amount to the M.D. anesthesiologist and 50 percent (50%) of the full schedule amount to the CRNA.    4. The M.D. anesthesiologist shall remain within the immediate vicinity of the CRNAs that are receiving medical direction, and shall not simultaneously extend supervision to more than four (4) anesthetists at one time.    5. When the M.D. anesthesiologist is acting as the operative surgeon in procedures such as pain management and blocks, the physician shall be reimbursed per the Maximum Fee Schedule for Physicians as appropriate for the procedure performed per the CPT-4 manual in current use. The M.D. anesthesiologist, in cases such as this, shall not charge for direction, supervision or performance of any anesthesia services.    6. When the M.D. anesthesiologist is acting as the deliverer of anesthesia for those services not addressed in the ASA Relative Value Guide a relative value of 4 base units shall be assigned with no time. Reimbursement shall be based on the 4 units and the Maximum Fee Schedule for Anesthesia.    7. When the M.D. anesthesiologist is acting as the deliverer of anesthesia for pain blocks a relative value of 4 base units shall be assigned. Billing shall include the 4 base units and the time expended for the performance of the procedure. Reimbursement shall be based on the 4 base units, 2 units of time, and the Maximum Fee Schedule for Anesthesia."    (i) When the operative surgeon requests monitoring by a CRNA, and anesthesia services is dictated by medical necessity, and the CRNA monitors the anesthesia during the flat rate procedure, the CRNA shall be reimbursed at 50 percent (50%) of the Basic Unit Value allowed the M.D. anesthesiologist. The operative surgeon shall justify through documentation the medical necessity of the request.    (ii) When the CRNA is not medically directed by the M.D. anesthesiologist and medical necessity is met, the CRNA shall be reimbursed at 65 percent (65%) of the allowed amount or at 2.6 Basic Value Units per the Maximum Fee Schedule for Anesthesiologists.    8. When the M.D. anesthesiologist places specialized invasive monitoring devices, such as central venous catheters, arterial lines, and flow directed catheters (e.g., Swan-Ganz), the M.D. anesthesiologist shall be reimbursed per the Maximum Fee Schedule for Physicians as appropriate for the procedure performed per the CPT-4 manual in current use.    9. When the M.D. anesthesiologist is responsible for medically necessary postoperative pain management, payment shall be made as follows:    (i) For the insertion of continuous epidural catheter (CPT-4 code 62279) when placed the day of surgery or during the first postoperative day, provided the catheter was not used to deliver the anesthesia during the surgical procedure. This code includes placement of the catheter and injection of the anesthetic substance. Reimbursement shall be per the Maximum Fee Schedule for Physicians.   (ii) For the daily management of the epidural for a reasonable period of time over the subsequent postoperative days (CPT-4 code 01996). Daily management of the epidural shall not be allowed on the same day as insertion of the catheter.   (iii) Patient Controlled Analgesia (PCA) shall be reimbursed at four (4) basic units for initiation of pumps and evaluation of needs, regardless of the period involved.   (10) Modifiers - The CPT-4 Manual identifies all performed procedures that warrant the use of modifiers. Only those modifiers found in the guidelines to each section of the CPT-4 may be applied. Multiple surgery procedures have been addressed in Rule 480-5-5-.15(2). Modifiers shall be used only as medically necessary and appropriate. When multiple procedures are performed by the same provider on the same day or during the same session, reimbursement for Modifier -51 shall be made at 100 percent (100%) for the procedure with the highest Workers' Compensation fee schedule allowance and 50 percent (50%) of the approved rate for all additional procedures which are medically necessary and appropriate and not incidental to the other. Other reimbursement adjustments shall be dependent upon the individual modifier and the Alabama Department of Industrial Relations Administrative Code, Utilization Management and Bill Screening Chapter.   (11) Psychologist Services - Psychologist services shall be reimbursed as follows:   (a) Central nervous system assessments/tests, as defined in the Physicians' Current Procedural Terminology Manual, performed by a clinical psychologist shall be reimbursed at 100 percent (100%) of the allowable amount as stated in the Maximum Fee Schedule for Physicians.   (b) All other clinical psychologist services, other than central nervous system assessments/tests, furnished outside of the hospital inpatient setting shall be reimbursed at 75 percent (75%) of the allowable amount as stated in the Maximum Fee Schedule for Physicians.   (c) Central nervous system assessments/tests, if ordered by a physician, performed by a non-clinical psychologist shall be reimbursed at 100 percent (100%) of the allowable amount as stated in the Maximum Fee Schedule for Physicians. All other services provided by a non-clinical psychologist shall not be reimbursable.   (12) Physician Assistant/Nurse Practitioner - Utilization of the physician assistant/nursing practitioner shall be defined as an extension of the authorized treating physician. These providers may perform procedures and treatments at the direction of the authorized treating physician in accordance with their certification and do evaluation and management of patients at a very minimal decision making capacity, such as:   (a) Evaluation and management of a new patient which requires a problem focused history, a problem focused examination, and straightforward medical decision making (CPT code 99201 or subsequent code); or   (b) Evaluation and management of an established patient that may not require the presence of a physician. Usually, the presenting problem is minimal (CPT code 99211 or subsequent code).   1. Any written documentation/report/statement by the physician assistant/nurse practitioner shall be approved and counter-signed by the treating physician within 48 hours or two working days of the visit.   2. If the treating physician employs a physician assistant/nurse practitioner, the M.D. treating physician shall obtain authorization from the employer/agent after the first visit for the physician assistant/nurse practitioner to provide continued service. The authorization shall determine the number of visits which shall require the treating physician's presence, and the number of visits that the physician assistant/nurse practitioner may examine/treat the patient without the presence of the treating physician.   3. The authorized treating physician must personally determine all return to work, work restrictions, maximum medical improvement, impairment ratings, and referrals as these are complicated medical decision issues which are impacted by legal issues within the Workers' Compensation Law.   (2) Reimbursement for the services of the physician assistant/nurse practioner shall be consistent with the following:   (a) The bill for services shall reflect whether a service was rendered by the M.D. physician or the non-physician practitioner. The modifier AN shall be used if services are solely provided by the physician assistant. The appropriate HCPCS modifier shall be used to indicate services that have solely been provided by the nurse practitioner.    (b) The fee for service shall be 100 percent (100%) of the fee schedule for treatments and procedures as directed by the M.D. physician. The appropriate evaluation and management code may be used when the M.D. physician is providing the services with the physician assistant or nurse practitioner augmenting or assisting in some capacity. If the physician assistant or nurse practitioner is the sole provider of service, then the evaluation and management codes are limited to 99201 or 99211, or subsequent code.    (c) No payment shall be allowed for evaluation and management services should it be determined by the employer/agent that the services were billed improperly and/or that the physician assistant or nurse practitioner was providing services other than simple straightforward evaluation and management services.    (d) Payment is to be made directly to the facility or physician that employs the physician assistant or nurse practitioner. Nurse practitioners who have their own independent practice may bill using the HCFA 1500 claim form and CPT/HCPCS codes.    (13) NEW AND ESTABLISHED PATIENT - The guidelines for determining if an injured worker will be classified as a new or established patient for the purposes of coding and billing for medical treatment shall be found in the Evaluation and Management (E/M) Services Guidelines of the Physicians' CPT-4.

The MRO shall not, however, consider the results of urine samples that are not obtained or processed in accordance with Code of Ala. 1975, 25-5-330 through 25-5-340. (2) Reporting and Review of Results: (a) Positive Result - An essential part of the drug testing program is the final review of confirmed positive results from the laboratory. A positive test result does not automatically identify an employee/applicant as having used drugs in violation of employer policies. This review shall be performed by the Medical Review Officer (MRO) prior to the transmission of the results to employer administrative officials. The MRO review shall include review of the chain of custody to ensure that it is complete and sufficient on its face. 1.

Only the MRO may authorize such a reanalysis. IF the reanalysis of the single sample or analysis of the split sample fails to reconfirm the presence of the drug or drug metabolite, or if the split specimen is unavailable, inadequate for testing or untestable, the MRO shall cancel the test and report the cancellation to the employer.  4. If an employee has not contacted the MRO within 72 hours, the employee may present to the MRO information documenting that serious illness, injury, inability to contact the MRO, lack of actual notice of the verified positive test, or other circumstances unavoidably prevented the employee from timely contacting the MRO. If the MRO concludes that there is a legitimate explanation for the employee's failure to contact the MRO within 72 hours, the MRO shall direct that the reanalysis of the primary specimen or analysis of the split specimen, as applicable, be performed. (b) Negative Result - The duties of the MRO with respect to negative results are purely administrative. (3) Blind Performance Test Procedures: (a) Each employer or MRO shall use blind testing quality control procedures as provided in this rule.

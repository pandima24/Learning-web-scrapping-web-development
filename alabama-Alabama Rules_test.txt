--->alabama--->Alabama Rules--->Chapter 480-5-1 General Provisions--->480-5-1-.08 Policies And Procedures For Mediation Of Workers' Compensation Disputes By An Ombudsman
===================================================================
(1) Agreement of Parties - Mediation is a process where the parties to a dispute, with the help of an impartial third party (the "mediator"), attempt to work out a mutually satisfactory settlement of the dispute. Mediation is a process whereby either party may terminate the mediation at any time. Neither the Department of Industrial Relations (DIR) nor any mediator has the power of authority to force the parties to mediate or to accept an agreement or settlement.
(2) Initiating the Mediation Process - To begin the mediation process, either party should contact the DIR. When all parties have acknowledged a willingness to mediate, they will then enter into an Agreement to Mediate, and an Ombudsmen shall inform all parties of their rights and responsibilities under the Workers' Compensation Act of Alabama.
(3) Appointment of a Mediator - Following an agreement of the parties to mediate, DIR will select a mediator from its ombudsmen. No Person shall serve as a mediator in any dispute in which that person has any financial or personal interest in the result of the mediation. Prior to accepting an appointment, the prospective mediator shall disclose any circumstances likely to create a presumption of bias or interest in the outcome of the proceedings, or prevent a prompt meeting with the parties. The fact that the selected mediator may already have some familiarity with the case through work as an ombudsmen shall not disqualify the ombudsmen as a mediator unless either party objects to such mediator. In the event that a mediator is objected to, the DIR will select a new mediator from its ombudsmen. If a mediator is not able to continue the mediation process once started, the DIR will select another mediator from its ombudsmen.
(4) Scheduling - Upon appointment, the mediator will work with the parties to establish the time and location of a mediation session. Additional mediation sessions may be scheduled as agreed by the parties and the mediator.
(5) Conduct of Mediation Sessions - Prior to the first scheduled session the mediator may require the parties to provide the mediator with a brief memorandum setting forth the party's position with regard to the issues that need to be resolved. At the direction of the mediator, the memorandum may be exchanged by the parties.
(a) At the first session, the parties shall produce all information reasonably required for the mediator to understand the issues presented. The mediator may require either party to supplement this information.
(b) At the mediation session(s), the mediator will conduct an orderly settlement negotiation. Parties shall be represented by a person with authority to settle the case. The mediator will be impartial in such proceedings and has no authority to force the parties to agree to a settlement. The mediator may conduct separate meetings (caucus) with each party in order to improve the mediator's understanding of the respective positions of each party or to move the mediation process forward. The mediator shall not disclose to the adverse party confidential information provided by a party unless that party authorizes the disclosure.
(6) Authority of Mediator - The mediator does not have authority to impose a settlement upon the parties, but shall attempt to help the parties reach a satisfactory resolution of their dispute. The mediator may direct questions to any of the parties or their representatives to supplement or clarify information. Whenever necessary, the mediator may obtain expert advice concerning technical aspects of the dispute. Arrangements for obtaining such advice shall be made by the mediator or by the parties. The mediator is authorized to end the mediation whenever, in the judgment of the mediator, further efforts at mediation would not contribute to a resolution of the dispute between the parties.
(7) Privacy - Mediation sessions are private. The parties and their representatives may attend mediation sessions. Other persons may attend only with permission of the parties and with the consent of the mediator.
(8) Confidentiality - The mediator shall not divulge information disclosed to the mediator by the parties or by witnesses in the course of mediation. All records, reports, or other documents received by a mediator or prepared by the mediator while serving as a mediator shall be considered confidential. The mediator shall not be compelled in any adversary proceeding or judicial forum to divulge the contents of such documents or the fact that such documents exist or testify in regard to the mediation.
(a) The parties recognize that mediation sessions are settlement negotiations and that all offers, promises, conduct and statements, whether written or oral, made in the course of the proceedings are confidential and inadmissible in any litigation or arbitration of their dispute, including, but not limited to: views expressed or settlement suggestions made by the parties or the mediator; admissions made by any party; responsibility for termination or failure of the mediation process; or the fact that one party backed out of a settlement before it became binding on the parties. By participating in the mediation process; or the fact that one party backed out of a settlement before it became binding on the parties. By participating in the mediation process, the parties agree not to subpoena or otherwise require the mediator to testify or produce records, notes or work product in any adversarial proceedings between the parties. Any party that attempts to obtain such confidential information shall, and hereby agrees to, reimburse the mediator and the DIR for all fees and costs associated with resisting said attempts. However, evidence that is otherwise admissible or discoverable shall not be rendered inadmissible or non-discoverable as a result of its use in the mediation session.
(b) In the event the parties do reach a settlement agreement during the mediation which becomes final and binding in accordance with the provisions of Section 39 of Act No. 92-537, that settlement agreement will be admissible in court or arbitration proceedings to enforce it.
(9) No record - There shall be no formal record made of the mediation proceedings and no recordings or stenographic records shall be made.
(10) Counsel - The parties may be represented by an attorney at any stage of the mediation process. An employee shall be advised at the first mediation session of his or her right to be represented by counsel by a writing which shall be notarized.
(11) Settlement - If a dispute is resolved in whole or in part during mediation, the ombudsmen shall reduce the agreement in writing, and the ombudsmen and each party shall sign the agreement. The signed agreement shall be binding on all parties unless within 60 days after the agreement is signed a court of competent jurisdiction relieves all parties of the effect of the agreement because of fraud, newly discovered evidence, or other good cause. At the end of said 60 day period, the agreement shall be final and irrevocable. At any time during the 60 day period, the parties may present the settlement agreement to a court of competent jurisdiction for approval in accordance with the Workers' Compensation Act of Alabama.
(a) At the first mediation session the employee shall be advised by the ombudsmen in writing which is notarized that he or she have a right to have any settlement or his or her claim reviewed by a court of competent jurisdiction at any time within 60 days after the date of the settlement and that at the end of 60 days the settlement shall be final and irrevocable.
(12) Termination - The mediation shall be terminated by the parties reaching a settlement; by a declaration by the mediator to the effect that, in the opinion of the mediator, further efforts at mediation are no longer worthwhile; or by a declaration by any party, at any time, that the mediation proceedings are terminated.

===================================================================
--->alabama--->Alabama Rules--->Chapter 480-5-3 Group Self-insurance--->480-5-3-.09 Departmental Intervention
===================================================================
 
The Director may involve the trustees in a Fund's day to day management if he/she determines that a Fund is in violation of the Law, these Rules, or is potentially impaired and that the Administrator is unwilling or unable to correct the deficiencies. This rule contemplates the need for the Department to have guidelines under which it may intervene in the management of a Fund in order to ensure its viability or, in the event this is not achievable, provide for its orderly dissolution. Four levels of intervention are described, each with a triggering mechanism and a resolution process. Circumstances, in the discretion of the Director, may require acceleration of the process. Specifically, the Director may choose to initiate intervention at Phase II.
(a) Phase I - (Probation). If the Director determines that any violation of these Rules, the Law, or perceived financial impairment cannot be remedied in a timely manner through normal discourse with the Administrator, the Director will call for a meeting with the Fund's Trustees to informally discuss his concerns. All parties will seek to reach consensus on the extent of any violations or financial impairments and on remedial actions to be taken.
(b) Phase II - (Remediation). If the Director determines that implementation of Phase I has not satisfied his concerns, or that violations or impairments are so acute as to warrant immediate documentation he may require the Trustees to submit a written remediation plan. The written plan will be negotiated between the Director and the Trustees and will include specific objectives with verifiable and measurable outcomes. The implementation timeline for meeting the objectives of the written plan will be mutually agreed upon and in the event of no agreement the Director will establish time deadlines.
(c) Phase III - (Supervision). If written objectives are not achieved in a timely manner, the Director will appoint an employee of the Department to make and/or approve all management and financial decisions of the Fund. The Director's appointee will make all reasonable efforts to resolve all violations and impairments. The principle goal will be ensuring the Fund's existence as a going concern and returning the managerial decision making function to the Trustees. The Director will notify each Fund Participant that the Fund providing its workers' compensation coverage is under Departmental supervision. The notice will contain a brief description of problems leading to this action and an outline of the Department's plans to rehabilitate the Fund. A copy of this notice must be provided to all the individuals or companies that market to prospective Fund Participants. This list of marketing persons will be supplied to the Department by the Fund at such time the Fund is placed in supervision. The Director will determine within one year whether the Fund's rehabilitation is successful. The Director may limit a Fund from writing any new business for a period of time until the supervision is successfully completed. Any Fund which cannot be successfully rehabilitated within one year will be dissolved unless a plan of merger is approved by the Director.
(d) Phase IV - (Revocation). If the Director determines that violation or impairments have not been remedied by operation of this Rule, or that the Fund is insolvent, he may revoke the Fund's self-insurance privilege. The Director shall give written notice of such revocation to the Fund and its Service Company. The Fund shall have thirty (30) days from the mailing of the notice to request a hearing on the revocation. Failure to request a hearing within the prescribed time shall result in the revocation becoming effective sixty (60) days from the mailing of the original notice. In no event shall a revocation become effective prior to the date that a hearing (if a hearing is requested) is scheduled. Such notice shall be served personally or by certified or registered mail to the Fund Administrator and to the Fund Trustees. In the event of the insolvency of a Fund, the Director will declare the Fund insolvent and invoke joint and several liability and assess Fund Participants by Fund year such amounts as are necessary to satisfy the liabilities of the Fund. After all the liabilities are satisfied, the Director will order the Trustees to return any unencumbered funds to each Participant in the same proportion as each has been assessed.
(e) An administrative action taken by the Department for violation of the Law or these Rules may be appealed by the aggrieved party to the Circuit Court of Montgomery County, Alabama, within thirty (30) days of the effective date of the administrative action.

===================================================================
--->alabama--->Alabama Rules--->Chapter 480-5-6 Drug-Free Workplace Program--->480-5-6-.03 Substance Abuse Testing
===================================================================
(1) The specimen collected for substance abuse testing may be tissue, blood, urine, breath, or other product of the human body that is capable of revealing the presence of drugs or their metabolites or of alcohol. However, the collection of any specimen constitutes a search under the Fourth Amendment because it implicates significant privacy concerns. Therefore, to balance the degrees of intrusion on the individual's privacy interest against the promotion of the employer's legitimate interests, the preferred specimen is:
(a) Urine for drug testing, and
(b) Breath for alcohol testing.
2) The methodology and procedures for alcohol testing shall conform to the Department of Transportation (D)T) 49 Code of Federal Regulation Part 40, Procedures For Transportation Workplace Drug Testing Programs, Subpart A - General and Subpart C - Alcohol Testing. Except for those employees who must comply with DOT standards, an employee shall be determined to be under the influence of alcohol if the employee's normal facilities are impaired due to the consumption of alcohol or the employee has an alcohol level of .08 or higher, except for safety sensitive functions the alcohol level may be .04 or higher.




===================================================================
--->alabama--->Alabama Rules--->Chapter 480-5-6 Drug-Free Workplace Program--->480-5-6-.04 Medical Review Officer
===================================================================
(1) Qualifications and Responsibilities:
(a) The MRO shall not be an employee of the laboratory conducting the drug test unless the laboratory establishes a clear separation of functions to prevent any appearance of a conflict of interest.
(2) Reporting and Review of Results:
1. Prior to making a final decision to verify a positive test result for an individual, the MRO shall give the individual an opportunity to discuss the test results with him or her.
2. Following verification of a positive test result, the MRO shall, as provided in the employer's policy, refer the case to the employer's employee assistance or rehabilitation program, if applicable, to the management official empowered to recommend or take administrative action (or the officials' designated agent), or both.
3. The MRO shall notify each employee who has a confirmed positive test that the employee has 72 hours in which to request a reanalysis of the original specimen, if the single sample method of collection was used, or request a test of the split specimen, if the split sample method of collection was used, if the test is verified as positive.
Only the MRO may authorize such a reanalysis. IF the reanalysis of the single sample or analysis of the split sample fails to reconfirm the presence of the drug or drug metabolite, or if the split specimen is unavailable, inadequate for testing or untestable, the MRO shall cancel the test and report the cancellation to the employer.
4. If an employee has not contacted the MRO within 72 hours, the employee may present to the MRO information documenting that serious illness, injury, inability to contact the MRO, lack of actual notice of the verified positive test, or other circumstances unavoidably prevented the employee from timely contacting the MRO. If the MRO concludes that there is a legitimate explanation for the employee's failure to contact the MRO within 72 hours, the MRO shall direct that the reanalysis of the primary specimen or analysis of the split specimen, as applicable, be performed.
(3) Blind Performance Test Procedures:
(a) Each employer or MRO shall use blind testing quality control procedures as provided in this rule.
(b) Each employer or MRO shall submit three blind performance test specimens for each 100 employee specimens it submits, up to a maximum of 100 blind performance test specimens submitted per quarter.
